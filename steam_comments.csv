730;Counter-Strike 2;The gunplay is the worst ive seen in a video game. How do people enjoy this?
730;Counter-Strike 2;No explanation needed XD
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hi, my name is Vlad and I have been playing cs since 2011. First I played cs 1.6, and then I played more than 1000 hours of csgo. Maybe this is not much compared to many players, but for me it is quite a lot. I loved playing csgo. I consider it one of the most influential and best games of its kind. CS has a very ingenious gameplay that will appeal to a lot of people. It has different maps, different modes, and interesting operations from time to time.

And now I, like everyone else, have moved on to cs2 and it's hard to describe my disappointment. According to the developers' idea and the players' expectations, cs2 was supposed to be a step forward. A significant step. Not just a big update. This release was positioned as the release of a new game, but in reality, it turned out to be quite different. 

I do not understand all the nuances of the technical component of the game and I do not have to. I'm speaking my impressions purely as a player, from the experience I've had with the game: everything has become much worse. Not better. And the main problem with this is the lack of development of this project. It's a very crude game with a lot of technical problems. 

And I don't understand the motivation of the Valve at all, and the reasons why they did this. What required such a hasty release, which will obviously be a disappointment for the players? I don't think they are all very stupid there. I think they were well aware that they needed more time to satisfy their fans.

But they acted as if they didn't care at all. And now they're getting well-deserved hate and devastating criticism. It's a real shame for the game, I loved it so much, and now I'm actively looking at alternative projects to enjoy the full gameplay (like many other players)."
730;Counter-Strike 2;R.I.P CSGO
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I've been a Counter-Strike fan since the early days, and I was eagerly anticipating the release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). From the moment I booted up the game, I was blown away by the visuals. The Source 2 engine brings the game's environments and characters to life in stunning detail, and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive.

The gameplay is also top-notch. CS2 retains the core mechanics that have made Counter-Strike a success for over two decades, but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern. The team-based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever, and the game's competitive depth is unmatched.

However, my enjoyment of CS2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating. I've encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches, and it's starting to ruin the experience for me. It's frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks, and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game's competitive nature.

I know that Valve is working on improving VAC, but it doesn't seem to be enough at the moment. Cheating is a serious problem in CS2, and it's something that Valve needs to address as soon as possible.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first-person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren't for the prevalence of cheating."
730;Counter-Strike 2;20 years industry leading PC FPS still has an embarrassing anti cheat
730;Counter-Strike 2;Spoko gierka
730;Counter-Strike 2;A game where you can meet people with different ethnic backgrounds. I jump with ecstasy whenever I interact with this friendly and welcoming community.  A non-toxic diverse community where race, gender and religion has not restrictions. 11/10.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Your team in every random competitive game:

- You
- Russian Guy
- Another Russian Guy
- A 6 year old kid who slept with your mother
- Russian Guy who speaks English"
730;Counter-Strike 2;Awful game. CS:GO was obviously better
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I'm sorry, Valve, but your idea of a CS game s**u**c**k**s a**s**s with a straw.
CS:GO was just fine the way it was.
The only thing it needed was a better anti-cheat system, just like TF2 does... instead you made the game crap. You made me have more fun playing CS 1.6 and that's really saying something.
Tell me, what was wrong with [TEAM] DEATHMATCH? Why does friendly-fire have to be enabled by default in my ex-favorite game mode? I know, right? Why WOULD you concentrate on killing the enemy team? Nooo. Just kill each other. It's much more fun to not be able to even tell what's going on.
Or the gun-game. Or everything else. I had to fiddle around for 15 damn minutes trying to equip my StatTrak weapon - because that is the reason I paid money for it, to use it - until i found out it's a drag-and-drop system, and you can no longer select from a multitude of weapons.
You know what? I want my money back for CS:GO, since the game is no longer in my game library. I don't want this utter crap you replaced it with."
730;Counter-Strike 2;They deleted CSGO for this shIt
730;Counter-Strike 2;Only have russians who dont speak english, are toxic and on shit ping make them their own server.
730;Counter-Strike 2;This may come as a shock to some, but the anti-cheat does not work. Not only does it fail to ban real cheaters, today after loosing a string of games, with a negative and frankly embarrassing kd, I myself was VAC banned. I have never cheated in a video game, no scripts, not a single dodgy download, nada. I don't care that I cant play this shitty game, I care that my reputation is now tarnished because of a false ban. We shall see how customer support deals with this, but somehow I doubt I will get any justice.
730;Counter-Strike 2;My life would've probably improved significantly if I spent those 52.6 hours doing something else
730;Counter-Strike 2;lot of cheaters
730;Counter-Strike 2;give us back csgo. you cant serious expect me to enjoy this game after removing my favorite map (train) and 11 years worth of csgo history. we even found a way to go back to csgo and you removed it just because of a stupid fucking split in the player base?! you could have just made cs2 its own game and give it a better name with new maps, new skins, new gamemodes, you could even add more operations to advance the cs lore and make more money cause it seems like to me thats all your starting to care about valve. dont forget about the fps drops, e.g csgo could run on any computer at good fps but cs2 needs a modern day computer to be playable. better idea, instead of spending all that time making cs2 YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN US A REAL FUCKING UPDATE FOR TF2, HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING VALVE. this whole scenario reminds me of titanfall 2 and apex (apex shoud have been titanfall 3) but i feel that was more ruined by ea. even if i havent played csgo since its release i still know that cs2 is shit. i did learn something from cs2 and that was that earth is the closest planet to the sun, i know that the whole brightness thing was for visibility but still WHY IS IT SO FUCKING BRIGHT, IT LOOKS SO BAD, i cant even fix it ive tried and it just doesnt work, no matter what i do its still bright, can you at least give us an option to make it look like csgo again? im gonna end my rant here because honestly i feel like no matter how much people complain you wont do shit valve, so ill see you all in hell and if you make half life 3 do it on source not source 2, source 2 sucks dick.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"A literal downgrade of CSGO. Gameplay changes, aesthetics etc. all worse than they were.

Other negatives:
-Ui placement and navigation is confusing and overcomplicated.
-By default the crosshair follows the spray pattern wich means your aim will go EVERYWHERE where you arent aiming, making proper shooting even harder unless you mess with a load of settings. This feature is literally confusing and unnecessary.
-The community is literal filth. Nonstop toxic ppl insulting, griefing, teamkilling, shouting and in a single match i heard the n word more than i did in my entire life. (now imagine all of this in every match)
-The anti cheat is technically non existant. 8/10 matches have at least 1 blatant cheater. And thats with the premium ""safe"" matchmaking.
-The amount of russian players has only increased wich HEAVILY increased toxicity.
-Somehow the gunplay feels even more unpredictable and unstable making fights feel as if you have to be lucky to get anything done.

Overall do yourselves a favor and play literally anything else coz this game is literally a waste of time at this point."
730;Counter-Strike 2;"No more map faction playermodels but you can look at your legs :ooooo

Fuck off Valve"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"You will get banned for griefing a lot.
This game isn't good for your sanity. 
CS2 is a waste of time and garbage compared to CSGO."

730;Counter-Strike 2;It's unbelievable how many cheaters are playing and nothing can't stop them. I'm playing CS from the very beginning (year 2000) and never had such a bad experience as now. Cheating is ruining the whole game :(.

730;Counter-Strike 2;A lot of Russia and Ukraine people who trolling game and left MM, idk why. But is real tragedy for CS 2. Real best time in CSGO is 2014-2018 other is cheaters, toxic and other idiots
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Wallhackers are running rampant last few weeks, competitive is barely playable as of now, due to people always knowing where you are.

The biggest problem is still the same as in CS:GO, cheaters have easy access to new accounts so the margin never changes. I'm actually thinking about dropping PvP games completely, humankind is cancer."
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Dear Valve,

Please give us CS:GO back. We didn't pay for this pile of hot shit. I bought CS:GO before it was free to play and you have just deleted my game. I don't give a rats ass what your terms of service say, I payed for a good game and you took it away from me. You didn't even have the decency to replace it with something that works or is a finished product.

Also valve, grow a pair. release CS2 as a standalone game alongside CS:GO and let the player numbers speak for themselves. Valve would never do this because then everyone would see that people are playing CS:GO over this trash.

GTFO,
The People who Gave you Money XOXOXO!!!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;dogsht
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 - Even though it's a glorified upgrade. You can't really do much to make the CS formula better. The main modification is the increased dynamic fog that is impacted by nades and gunshots. Otherwise, images now appear literally ""polished""... a tad bit brighter, clearer, less grainy, and warmer. Additionally, the user interface has been improved.

Gameplay wise it is the identical antique, bullet spread appears more random even as shifting however otherwise can not notice something else. however in any other case this update is simply refinement.. do not anticipate some thing to blow you out of the water.

730;Counter-Strike 2;I got VAC Banned for NVIDIA issue and they solved it very quickly!

730;Counter-Strike 2;Good Game
730;Counter-Strike 2;CHEATERS EVERYWHERE
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Same game as CSGO but no net_graph, replay or wheel

Lag and stutter increased"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This is difficult for me to write because I have always loved CS, back in the 1.6 days and moving forward into Source and although I never transitioned into CS:Go, I did come back for CS2, albeit with a far diminished skill set, reduced reflexes and far less hours to 'get gud' again.

Here is where the problems start.  I get that im not so good, i die far more often then i get a kill, but does this justify being abused in a match?  Amongst other things, I have been abused due to my race and disability, and its horrendous getting these verbals thrown at you because you are not as good as others.  I have kick votes made against me - because im not as good.  This abuse has been in competitive and casual, in fact i stick to casual now as i realise im crap and dont want to impact peoples 'competitive' stats.

So why the negative review?  
1) Bots dont help me close the competitive gap.  I am stuck in no mans land - not good enough for online and playing offline with bots I go through a match without dying and have top kills.  The bots are not hard enough to push the gap between offline and online.

2) Ranking - the game is putting me with players clearly superior to myself which is frustrating for both parties.  Why are there not official 'noob friendly' servers or a ranking system that works to separate out good from bad players?

3) Toxic players - The vast majority of players are fine but the vitriol from the minority ruin the matches in which they are present."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Terrible rework. Bring back CS:GO.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Ta com cheater demais, não ta dando, vou dar uma pausa de 3 meses, boa sorte.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Its 2024... This game might be a ""Staple"" because everyone has played it for the past 25 years, but it's not offering anything original, new, or a new perspective on the subject. It's just the good old same game, just with upgraded graphics. So, of course, if you are nostalgic, or if you feel that investing time in another game might be to much, or if you just want to fall into your old shoes for the sake of not feeling any discomfort from evolving to something new, please continue playing this game.

In the end I recommend to people who just want to stay in 1999.

I don't recommend to anyone who hasn't played the game non stop for the past 25 years... it just feels comfortable like very outdated, dirty, old slippers."
730;Counter-Strike 2;I am just glad they finally fixed this bug that causing constant packet loss. Well, actually the packet loss is still there, except the video stream is smooth now so I don't feel as much.
730;Counter-Strike 2;its a fun game. you have about a 90% chance of running into toxic lobbies and players but if you have your viop down to 0 it makes those lobbies bearable, you can also actually hear footsteps and stuff better instead of people just yelling at each other as well with it set to that.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Play cs 2 (5 hour), NICE GAME in the WORLD =)
730;Counter-Strike 2;BETTER THAN VALORANT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Really cannot understand how they got the gun mechanics so bad in this historically famous gun game, as someone who was reasonably high rank in CSGO back in the day, and enjoyed the game, I would say this game has the worst gun play of all the major FPS games. How many times do you do 20dmg in 8 shots at point blank range or have your cross hairs on a target, continue to hold crosshairs on target only to find out you hit them once or not at all.
- Horrible Gun play
- Horrible Audio (no idea what they have done but you can now hear everyone on the map)
- Horrible optimisation
- Removed a lot of enjoyable classic maps
- Game feels rushed for a game that's been like a decade in the making.
+ I can make a significant amount of steam bucks for selling my inventory.

Really enjoy watching the game but cannot stand playing this game again and that's not even considering the Russian kids as team mates."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Game just needs to bring back surf or just workshop maps back in general
730;Counter-Strike 2;yeah this game has worse match making than c.o.d, i have 50 hours in this game and i'm being put in games with smurfs with  over 1800, 2k, 3k hours and i just get steamrolled. if youre new to this game like i am just dont play, bc i made the mistake of paying for premier and you have to be at level 10. getting to level 10 is taking roughly about 60 hours of just rage gaming and it sucks. dont pay for it. go play valorant or something bc this game is not where its at. this is a horrible time for new players till valve stop sucking.
730;Counter-Strike 2;bring back csgo
730;Counter-Strike 2;Maaaan...As a Solo Q player who really tried hard for improving and ranking to the top i strongly left with the feeling that every second game someone abandones the match and by 90% it's has to be from my team..As i used to track my performance which numbers were good it turned out that from 27 losses in a month 19 were due to an abandoned teammate.It's just so sad and annoying which made me unistall the game for a 3 month period. After the release of CS2 came back again..2 played games 2 times  abandoned teammate..hell nooo...

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hey, I've never played CS in any form in my life. Only Frontlines, Call of Duty or Battlefield. Lately I've been seeing YouTubers opening CS2 boxes with valuable contents and selling the stuff off. Some have 1K prices. Hmm, OK my plan: I'll buy CS2 and I don't need to play it, because they haven't patched in the rear sight and front sight yet, and concentrate me on the awesomeness of the loot boxes. Still had €39 credit on Steam. No sooner said than done - spent over €14 on CS2 and then bought 12 weapon boxes. Bought a special box that cost €4.65. You don't treat yourself to anything else. :) Steam account plundered down to the last cent, and generally empty again anyway. Well, the next day, today! I start the game full of expectation and virginity. First check the graphics, adjust the buttons, see what else is available...Ok, now it's time to get down to business - the weapon boxes with my top loot. I know myself, I'm a lucky guy.

730;Counter-Strike 2;Cs2 is so broken compared to cs:go. For example the ranking system is full of shit and the gun spray (e.g ak47) is destroyed. Also there is so easy to get headshot while running or jumping. I really hope so that the Valve repairing the game completely. Valve has been make several updates for repairing the issues and functionalities after the game is published. But still there is so many issues or even some functionality missing.. The game has been published too early! What the hell. There nothing to good to say.. ouh well the graphics is better. Hell yeah!

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients for four people:
Chicken fillet 400 g
Parsley 50 g
Pickled cucumber 6
Potatoes (optional) 2
Pita bread 4 (or as needed)
Olive oil 3 tbsp
Onion 1
Parmesan cheese 100 g
Salt 2 tbsp
Turmeric 1 tsp
Ground black pepper 2 tsp
Garlic powder 2 tsp

Ingredients for tahini sauce:
Thick yogurt 4 tbsp
Mayonnaise 1 tbsp
Tahini 1 tbsp
Fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
Garlic 1
Salt 1 tsp (or to taste)
Ground black pepper ½ tsp (or to taste)

Wash the chicken fillet, take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips. Add them to a mixing bowl.

Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.

Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This game got replaced. The reviews are from cs:go which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.

CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in cs:go.
This game is incomplete and shouldn't take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully.
New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn't worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but it's not ready to replace CS: GO and they shouldn't remove an existing game and turn off CS:GO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.

I feel scammed especially that I bought CS:GO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake."

730;Counter-Strike 2;my pc too potato to run this now
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being it's own game.

CS2's implementation of the networking system, ""Subtick"", is god fucking awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.

The aggravating meme of Ferrari peeks is ridiculous and there is no humanly way to fight someone that either doesn't appear on your screen until you are already dead, getting fucked by ghosts seemingly or seeing them for a fraction of a second giving the same outcome.

Playing against teams that just rush with P90's is like getting brutally ass fucked by a rusty, unlubed, bad dragon dildo without consent or courtesy to spit first which you are powerless to stop...unless you stop playing. It's even worse with peekers advantage being so bad that if you are even a semi-decent shot, someone with an AK-47 will be hitting your power off button more times than a retarded monkey in an IT shop.

Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrum's (network and performance) has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.

Change your beta branch to CSGO and wait a very fucking long time to play this garbage. Infuriating is the kindest way you could call the CS2 experience."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Shoulda left cs:go available
730;Counter-Strike 2;I paid for CS:GO once. Not CS2. Where is my game?
730;Counter-Strike 2;I appreciate the upgrade in fidelity, but I really miss Arms Race, Danger Zone,... which allowed me to practice CS in a fun way. I'm not a 100% hardcore dude, and since I can't play CSGO anymore I really feel like I can spend my time better with other games.
730;Counter-Strike 2;I'd like to play CSGO please.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Nobody reads reviews anyway, so I'll write that I'm a nice person
730;Counter-Strike 2;NICE ANTICHEAT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Finally the timeless Counter Strike got an update. Playing since Beta 7.1 through all iterations more or less active.
The best competitive shooter on the market. I like the changes to ingame skins, they look amazing with the new update. Sub-Tickrate improvement is as well great. Easy to play hard to master.

Negative:
- Anti Cheat software does not work as intended, too many cheaters in game 
- No regional server limitations (flooded with griefing, cheating, unfriendly player communities from the eastern part of Europe)
- Still some bugs with hitbox registration in-game
- New ranking system for matchmaking and premier is not balanced and is not motivating due to issues with point distribution

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Okay listen, life gets shorter and shorter every year. I have no free time with trying to afford my $2,500 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment while getting $15.25 an hour from serving at Lowes. This game makes me not have fun at the end of the night. I am never happy after a three hour session of CSGO ""2"". In fact, I now have high blood pressure at the ripe age of 26. I could have painted a painting, or learned to play the mandolin, or built a meaningful and supportive relationship. This game does not allow that. Save yourself. Save you. Today and Tomorrow and Tomorrow's Tomorrow."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cancerous piece of shit game, terrible movement and gun control compared to CSGO, shitty premier matchmaking that likes to put you in very unbalanced matches, no new maps and game modes as promised, the only thing it has over CSGO is that it looks better, come back when they fix this shit
730;Counter-Strike 2;Got banned from anticheat when i dont even know how to use cheats, in a normal competitive match playing with a friend who just started, anticheat is broken. When its many hackers and you ban the people who is playing without cheats.
730;Counter-Strike 2;So with every change there is turbulence and it's understandable that people in the pro scene get angry at sub-ticks, or lag-input or whatever the hell it is. But from the perspective of a 2k person, this upgrade is just bad, like there's no fucking way around it. There wasn't even a point in time where i doubted myself or tried to backtrack to check if i contradicted myself on some minor issues I've experienced. What's weird is that the issues themselves aren't even technical in their nature (for the most part), it's the fact that spray patterns have been tinkered with & it seems Valve fucked up the pacing and the models as well. Sometimes when i shoot at a person at point blank range i couldn't even fucking hs him even if my aim was dead-on and i wasn't moving, other times when i get kills from far away with ridiculously improbable angle whilst bursting where the person didn't even see me and wasn't peeking at all. Every single thing that wasn't an issue in cs:go became an issue now.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Better bring back cs go.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than Source.

730;Counter-Strike 2;Cheaters in every single match
730;Counter-Strike 2;I cannot believe i have spent 944 fucking hours thinking that i could possibly enjoy this game at any point. This is a prime example of the industrial revolution and its consequences and i could have spent that 1k hours doing something so much more important. Absolute waste of fucking time, fuck this game, and fuck you for playing it
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I really love CS, but at the state CS2 is now - I can't recommend this to anyone.
Subtick is terrible, sounds are trash (compared to what they were on CSGO) and the premier mm system is terrible (I'm convinced that a monkey wrote the algorithm)

Stay away from this for like 6 months, they might fix it...

Edit: Also wanted to add that competitive is filled with cheaters - at the point of adding this I've played 2 competitive matches on Dust2 (because I love this OG map and it is not in the Premier rotation) where the 1st one had an aimlock + wallhack player who did not even care to hide it. The 2nd match a player on the enemy team tilted after losing 7 rounds, toggled wall hack and proceeded to shoot everyone through walls.

That being said, if you're a new player definitely stay away, because you will need to play a lot of competitive matches to unlock premier mode."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than CS:GO somehow.
730;Counter-Strike 2;The gunplay is the worst ive seen in a video game. How do people enjoy this?
730;Counter-Strike 2;No explanation needed XD
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hi, my name is Vlad and I have been playing cs since 2011. First I played cs 1.6, and then I played more than 1000 hours of csgo. Maybe this is not much compared to many players, but for me it is quite a lot. I loved playing csgo. I consider it one of the most influential and best games of its kind. CS has a very ingenious gameplay that will appeal to a lot of people. It has different maps, different modes, and interesting operations from time to time.

And now I, like everyone else, have moved on to cs2 and it's hard to describe my disappointment. According to the developers' idea and the players' expectations, cs2 was supposed to be a step forward. A significant step. Not just a big update. This release was positioned as the release of a new game, but in reality, it turned out to be quite different. 

I do not understand all the nuances of the technical component of the game and I do not have to. I'm speaking my impressions purely as a player, from the experience I've had with the game: everything has become much worse. Not better. And the main problem with this is the lack of development of this project. It's a very crude game with a lot of technical problems. 

And I don't understand the motivation of the Valve at all, and the reasons why they did this. What required such a hasty release, which will obviously be a disappointment for the players? I don't think they are all very stupid there. I think they were well aware that they needed more time to satisfy their fans.

But they acted as if they didn't care at all. And now they're getting well-deserved hate and devastating criticism. It's a real shame for the game, I loved it so much, and now I'm actively looking at alternative projects to enjoy the full gameplay (like many other players)."
730;Counter-Strike 2;R.I.P CSGO
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I've been a Counter-Strike fan since the early days, and I was eagerly anticipating the release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). From the moment I booted up the game, I was blown away by the visuals. The Source 2 engine brings the game's environments and characters to life in stunning detail, and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive.

The gameplay is also top-notch. CS2 retains the core mechanics that have made Counter-Strike a success for over two decades, but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern. The team-based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever, and the game's competitive depth is unmatched.

However, my enjoyment of CS2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating. I've encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches, and it's starting to ruin the experience for me. It's frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks, and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game's competitive nature.

I know that Valve is working on improving VAC, but it doesn't seem to be enough at the moment. Cheating is a serious problem in CS2, and it's something that Valve needs to address as soon as possible.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first-person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren't for the prevalence of cheating."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Awful game. CS:GO was obviously better
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I'm sorry, Valve, but your idea of a CS game s**u**c**k**s a**s**s with a straw.
CS:GO was just fine the way it was.
The only thing it needed was a better anti-cheat system, just like TF2 does... instead you made the game crap. You made me have more fun playing CS 1.6 and that's really saying something.
Tell me, what was wrong with [TEAM] DEATHMATCH? Why does friendly-fire have to be enabled by default in my ex-favorite game mode? I know, right? Why WOULD you concentrate on killing the enemy team? Nooo. Just kill each other. It's much more fun to not be able to even tell what's going on.
Or the gun-game. Or everything else. I had to fiddle around for 15 damn minutes trying to equip my StatTrak weapon - because that is the reason I paid money for it, to use it - until i found out it's a drag-and-drop system, and you can no longer select from a multitude of weapons.
You know what? I want my money back for CS:GO, since the game is no longer in my game library. I don't want this utter crap you replaced it with."
730;Counter-Strike 2;They deleted CSGO for this shIt
730;Counter-Strike 2;Only have russians who dont speak english, are toxic and on shit ping make them their own server.
730;Counter-Strike 2;This may come as a shock to some, but the anti-cheat does not work. Not only does it fail to ban real cheaters, today after loosing a string of games, with a negative and frankly embarrassing kd, I myself was VAC banned. I have never cheated in a video game, no scripts, not a single dodgy download, nada. I don't care that I cant play this shitty game, I care that my reputation is now tarnished because of a false ban. We shall see how customer support deals with this, but somehow I doubt I will get any justice.
730;Counter-Strike 2;My life would've probably improved significantly if I spent those 52.6 hours doing something else
730;Counter-Strike 2;lot of cheaters
730;Counter-Strike 2;give us back csgo. you cant serious expect me to enjoy this game after removing my favorite map (train) and 11 years worth of csgo history. we even found a way to go back to csgo and you removed it just because of a stupid fucking split in the player base?! you could have just made cs2 its own game and give it a better name with new maps, new skins, new gamemodes, you could even add more operations to advance the cs lore and make more money cause it seems like to me thats all your starting to care about valve. dont forget about the fps drops, e.g csgo could run on any computer at good fps but cs2 needs a modern day computer to be playable. better idea, instead of spending all that time making cs2 YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN US A REAL FUCKING UPDATE FOR TF2, HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING VALVE. this whole scenario reminds me of titanfall 2 and apex (apex shoud have been titanfall 3) but i feel that was more ruined by ea. even if i havent played csgo since its release i still know that cs2 is shit. i did learn something from cs2 and that was that earth is the closest planet to the sun, i know that the whole brightness thing was for visibility but still WHY IS IT SO FUCKING BRIGHT, IT LOOKS SO BAD, i cant even fix it ive tried and it just doesnt work, no matter what i do its still bright, can you at least give us an option to make it look like csgo again? im gonna end my rant here because honestly i feel like no matter how much people complain you wont do shit valve, so ill see you all in hell and if you make half life 3 do it on source not source 2, source 2 sucks dick.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"A literal downgrade of CSGO. Gameplay changes, aesthetics etc. all worse than they were.

Other negatives:
-Ui placement and navigation is confusing and overcomplicated.
-By default the crosshair follows the spray pattern wich means your aim will go EVERYWHERE where you arent aiming, making proper shooting even harder unless you mess with a load of settings. This feature is literally confusing and unnecessary.
-The community is literal filth. Nonstop toxic ppl insulting, griefing, teamkilling, shouting and in a single match i heard the n word more than i did in my entire life. (now imagine all of this in every match)
-The anti cheat is technically non existant. 8/10 matches have at least 1 blatant cheater. And thats with the premium ""safe"" matchmaking.
-The amount of russian players has only increased wich HEAVILY increased toxicity.
-Somehow the gunplay feels even more unpredictable and unstable making fights feel as if you have to be lucky to get anything done.

Overall do yourselves a favor and play literally anything else coz this game is literally a waste of time at this point."

You didn't even have the decency to replace it with something that works or is a finished product.

Also valve, grow a pair. release CS2 as a standalone game alongside CS:GO and let the player numbers speak for themselves. Valve would never do this because then everyone would see that people are playing CS:GO over this trash.

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 - Even though it's a glorified upgrade. You can't really do much to make the CS formula better. The main modification is the increased dynamic fog that is impacted by nades and gunshots. Otherwise, images now appear literally ""polished""... a tad bit brighter, clearer, less grainy, and warmer. Additionally, the user interface has been improved.

Gameplay wise it is the identical antique, bullet spread appears more random even as shifting however otherwise can not notice something else. however in any other case this update is simply refinement.. do not anticipate some thing to blow you out of the water.

730;Counter-Strike 2;8/10
730;Counter-Strike 2;great game i love the competitive aspect however it feels a bit different to csgo
730;Counter-Strike 2;+
730;Counter-Strike 2;runs much worst then csgo, forced update is stupid
730;Counter-Strike 2;i need help.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Very relaxing game, especially after jumping off a plane and wrestling with a kangaroo
730;Counter-Strike 2;Its ok
730;Counter-Strike 2;What can you even say about this game. It's the greatest competitive team shooter ever.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Good Game
730;Counter-Strike 2;CHEATERS EVERYWHERE
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Same game as CSGO but no net_graph, replay or wheel

Lag and stutter increased"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This is difficult for me to write because I have always loved CS, back in the 1.6 days and moving forward into Source and although I never transitioned into CS:Go, I did come back for CS2, albeit with a far diminished skill set, reduced reflexes and far less hours to 'get gud' again.

Here is where the problems start.  I get that im not so good, i die far more often then i get a kill, but does this justify being abused in a match?  Amongst other things, I have been abused due to my race and disability, and its horrendous getting these verbals thrown at you because you are not as good as others.  I have kick votes made against me - because im not as good.  This abuse has been in competitive and casual, in fact i stick to casual now as i realise im crap and dont want to impact peoples 'competitive' stats.

So why the negative review?  
1) Bots dont help me close the competitive gap.  I am stuck in no mans land - not good enough for online and playing offline with bots I go through a match without dying and have top kills.  The bots are not hard enough to push the gap between offline and online.

2) Ranking - the game is putting me with players clearly superior to myself which is frustrating for both parties.  Why are there not official 'noob friendly' servers or a ranking system that works to separate out good from bad players?

3) Toxic players - The vast majority of players are fine but the vitriol from the minority ruin the matches in which they are present."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Terrible rework. Bring back CS:GO.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Ta com cheater demais, não ta dando, vou dar uma pausa de 3 meses, boa sorte.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Its 2024... This game might be a ""Staple"" because everyone has played it for the past 25 years, but it's not offering anything original, new, or a new perspective on the subject. It's just the good old same game, just with upgraded graphics. So, of course, if you are nostalgic, or if you feel that investing time in another game might be to much, or if you just want to fall into your old shoes for the sake of not feeling any discomfort from evolving to something new, please continue playing this game.

In the end I recommend to people who just want to stay in 1999.

I don't recommend to anyone who hasn't played the game non stop for the past 25 years... it just feels comfortable like very outdated, dirty, old slippers."
730;Counter-Strike 2;I am just glad they finally fixed this bug that causing constant packet loss. Well, actually the packet loss is still there, except the video stream is smooth now so I don't feel as much.
730;Counter-Strike 2;its a fun game. you have about a 90% chance of running into toxic lobbies and players but if you have your viop down to 0 it makes those lobbies bearable, you can also actually hear footsteps and stuff better instead of people just yelling at each other as well with it set to that.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Play cs 2 (5 hour), NICE GAME in the WORLD =)
730;Counter-Strike 2;BETTER THAN VALORANT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Really cannot understand how they got the gun mechanics so bad in this historically famous gun game, as someone who was reasonably high rank in CSGO back in the day, and enjoyed the game, I would say this game has the worst gun play of all the major FPS games. How many times do you do 20dmg in 8 shots at point blank range or have your cross hairs on a target, continue to hold crosshairs on target only to find out you hit them once or not at all.
- Horrible Gun play
- Horrible Audio (no idea what they have done but you can now hear everyone on the map)
- Horrible optimisation
- Removed a lot of enjoyable classic maps
- Game feels rushed for a game that's been like a decade in the making.
+ I can make a significant amount of steam bucks for selling my inventory.

Really enjoy watching the game but cannot stand playing this game again and that's not even considering the Russian kids as team mates."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Game just needs to bring back surf or just workshop maps back in general
730;Counter-Strike 2;yeah this game has worse match making than c.o.d, i have 50 hours in this game and i'm being put in games with smurfs with  over 1800, 2k, 3k hours and i just get steamrolled. if youre new to this game like i am just dont play, bc i made the mistake of paying for premier and you have to be at level 10. getting to level 10 is taking roughly about 60 hours of just rage gaming and it sucks. dont pay for it. go play valorant or something bc this game is not where its at. this is a horrible time for new players till valve stop sucking.
730;Counter-Strike 2;bring back csgo
730;Counter-Strike 2;Maaaan...As a Solo Q player who really tried hard for improving and ranking to the top i strongly left with the feeling that every second game someone abandones the match and by 90% it's has to be from my team..As i used to track my performance which numbers were good it turned out that from 27 losses in a month 19 were due to an abandoned teammate.It's just so sad and annoying which made me unistall the game for a 3 month period. After the release of CS2 came back again..2 played games 2 times  abandoned teammate..hell nooo...
730;Counter-Strike 2;csgo better :)
730;Counter-Strike 2;7.7 billion dollar company cant afford 128 tic server costs. Riot clearly cares more about their players than Valve. Inexcusable greed, garbage gaming experience, dead game

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 is like the world's most perfect saltine cracker. 

It's absolutely flawless. There's nothing wrong with it. It is the perfection of the thing it sets out to do.

But in the end, it's still just a saltine cracker--no flavor, no spice, no soul. 

So... it's fine. But there are more interesting things to put your mouth on."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Prime enabled account and cant play a single game without a wall hacker or aim hacker. Game is great but the fact that the anti cheat still doesnt work for shit blows my mind. Lets release a new game with zero fixes to the anti cheat. Game will always be full of scammers and cheaters. 10/10 would not recommend.
730;Counter-Strike 2;More Power to CS!
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worth it.

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Haven't seen a clean player in weeks. Everywhere you play it's just third worlders wasting all day cheating as 4-5 premades.
They will just abuse the report system on everyone and get you banned up to 2 weeks for absolutely no reason. None of the bans are checked for validity, just reach a threshold = ban.

Do not play this unless you cheat.
And if you cheat, well, I can't tell you what to do without getting banned from here."

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hey, I've never played CS in any form in my life. Only Frontlines, Call of Duty or Battlefield. Lately I've been seeing YouTubers opening CS2 boxes with valuable contents and selling the stuff off. Some have 1K prices. Hmm, OK my plan: I'll buy CS2 and I don't need to play it, because they haven't patched in the rear sight and front sight yet, and concentrate me on the awesomeness of the loot boxes. Still had €39 credit on Steam. No sooner said than done - spent over €14 on CS2 and then bought 12 weapon boxes. Bought a special box that cost €4.65. You don't treat yourself to anything else. :) Steam account plundered down to the last cent, and generally empty again anyway. Well, the next day, today! I start the game full of expectation and virginity. First check the graphics, adjust the buttons, see what else is available...Ok, now it's time to get down to business - the weapon boxes with my top loot. I know myself, I'm a lucky guy. (: Opened the hottest box, a noise sounds - lol? I still need a ******* key to open it?? €2.46/loot box key? oO
Product key refunded. Refundet? lol² - This product is non-refundable. Further information

Dude. Really? I'm looking completely stupid now. This pisses me off. :/"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I normally don't write reviews but what an absolute shit show of a system. You can report enemy/team mates ""griefing"" to get them suspended. AUTOMATED system once report count hits. 2023 in-game report system designed by interns.

730;Counter-Strike 2;Valve killed game :(
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cs2 is so broken compared to cs:go. For example the ranking system is full of shit and the gun spray (e.g ak47) is destroyed. Also there is so easy to get headshot while running or jumping. I really hope so that the Valve repairing the game completely. Valve has been make several updates for repairing the issues and functionalities after the game is published. But still there is so many issues or even some functionality missing.. The game has been published too early! What the hell. There nothing to good to say.. ouh well the graphics is better. Hell yeah!
730;Counter-Strike 2;same terrible game
730;Counter-Strike 2;Whoever thought having vote kick in a game mostly played by 13 year olds is a good idea needs to be banned from the game like me after being vote kicked twice for no reason.

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients for four people:
Chicken fillet 400 g
Parsley 50 g
Pickled cucumber 6
Potatoes (optional) 2
Pita bread 4 (or as needed)
Olive oil 3 tbsp
Onion 1
Parmesan cheese 100 g
Salt 2 tbsp
Turmeric 1 tsp
Ground black pepper 2 tsp
Garlic powder 2 tsp

Ingredients for tahini sauce:
Thick yogurt 4 tbsp
Mayonnaise 1 tbsp
Tahini 1 tbsp
Fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
Garlic 1
Salt 1 tsp (or to taste)
Ground black pepper ½ tsp (or to taste)

Wash the chicken fillet, take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips. Add them to a mixing bowl.

Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.

Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This game got replaced. The reviews are from cs:go which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.

CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in cs:go.
This game is incomplete and shouldn't take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully.
New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn't worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but it's not ready to replace CS: GO and they shouldn't remove an existing game and turn off CS:GO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.

I feel scammed especially that I bought CS:GO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake."

730;Counter-Strike 2;my pc too potato to run this now
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being it's own game.

CS2's implementation of the networking system, ""Subtick"", is god fucking awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.

The aggravating meme of Ferrari peeks is ridiculous and there is no humanly way to fight someone that either doesn't appear on your screen until you are already dead, getting fucked by ghosts seemingly or seeing them for a fraction of a second giving the same outcome.

Playing against teams that just rush with P90's is like getting brutally ass fucked by a rusty, unlubed, bad dragon dildo without consent or courtesy to spit first which you are powerless to stop...unless you stop playing. It's even worse with peekers advantage being so bad that if you are even a semi-decent shot, someone with an AK-47 will be hitting your power off button more times than a retarded monkey in an IT shop.

Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrum's (network and performance) has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.

Change your beta branch to CSGO and wait a very fucking long time to play this garbage. Infuriating is the kindest way you could call the CS2 experience."
730;Counter-Strike 2;chess for school shooters
730;Counter-Strike 2;My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on CS2 and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of vodka, some vodka, and bottle of vodka.. So I'm just gonna leave this here.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Removing CS:GO and not even offering a macOS version of CS2 is outrageous. Now I can't play at all.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Shoulda left cs:go available
730;Counter-Strike 2;I paid for CS:GO once. Not CS2. Where is my game?
730;Counter-Strike 2;I appreciate the upgrade in fidelity, but I really miss Arms Race, Danger Zone,... which allowed me to practice CS in a fun way. I'm not a 100% hardcore dude, and since I can't play CSGO anymore I really feel like I can spend my time better with other games.
730;Counter-Strike 2;I'd like to play CSGO please.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Nobody reads reviews anyway, so I'll write that I'm a nice person
730;Counter-Strike 2;NICE ANTICHEAT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Finally the timeless Counter Strike got an update. Playing since Beta 7.1 through all iterations more or less active.
The best competitive shooter on the market. I like the changes to ingame skins, they look amazing with the new update. Sub-Tickrate improvement is as well great. Easy to play hard to master.

Negative:
- Anti Cheat software does not work as intended, too many cheaters in game 
- No regional server limitations (flooded with griefing, cheating, unfriendly player communities from the eastern part of Europe)
- Still some bugs with hitbox registration in-game
- New ranking system for matchmaking and premier is not balanced and is not motivating due to issues with point distribution
"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Okay listen, life gets shorter and shorter every year. I have no free time with trying to afford my $2,500 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment while getting $15.25 an hour from serving at Lowes. This game makes me not have fun at the end of the night. I am never happy after a three hour session of CSGO ""2"". In fact, I now have high blood pressure at the ripe age of 26. I could have painted a painting, or learned to play the mandolin, or built a meaningful and supportive relationship. This game does not allow that. Save yourself. Save you. Today and Tomorrow and Tomorrow's Tomorrow."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cancerous piece of shit game, terrible movement and gun control compared to CSGO, shitty premier matchmaking that likes to put you in very unbalanced matches, no new maps and game modes as promised, the only thing it has over CSGO is that it looks better, come back when they fix this shit
730;Counter-Strike 2;Got banned from anticheat when i dont even know how to use cheats, in a normal competitive match playing with a friend who just started, anticheat is broken. When its many hackers and you ban the people who is playing without cheats.
730;Counter-Strike 2;So with every change there is turbulence and it's understandable that people in the pro scene get angry at sub-ticks, or lag-input or whatever the hell it is. But from the perspective of a 2k person, this upgrade is just bad, like there's no fucking way around it. There wasn't even a point in time where i doubted myself or tried to backtrack to check if i contradicted myself on some minor issues I've experienced. What's weird is that the issues themselves aren't even technical in their nature (for the most part), it's the fact that spray patterns have been tinkered with & it seems Valve fucked up the pacing and the models as well. Sometimes when i shoot at a person at point blank range i couldn't even fucking hs him even if my aim was dead-on and i wasn't moving, other times when i get kills from far away with ridiculously improbable angle whilst bursting where the person didn't even see me and wasn't peeking at all. Every single thing that wasn't an issue in cs:go became an issue now.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Better bring back cs go.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than Source.
730;Counter-Strike 2;im fat
730;Counter-Strike 2;Lol no
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Banning legit players while doing nothing about real cheaters and even rewarding them.
Great job Valve!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;Terrible game! CS:GO was miles better. Matchmaking, cheaters/hackers, gun play, tick rate, etc. got even worse than in CG:GO like HOW!!! PLEASE BRING CS:GO BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!
730;Counter-Strike 2;They removed arms race, there is no reason for me to keep this game on my computer.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cheaters in every single match
730;Counter-Strike 2;I cannot believe i have spent 944 fucking hours thinking that i could possibly enjoy this game at any point. This is a prime example of the industrial revolution and its consequences and i could have spent that 1k hours doing something so much more important. Absolute waste of fucking time, fuck this game, and fuck you for playing it
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I really love CS, but at the state CS2 is now - I can't recommend this to anyone.
Subtick is terrible, sounds are trash (compared to what they were on CSGO) and the premier mm system is terrible (I'm convinced that a monkey wrote the algorithm)

Stay away from this for like 6 months, they might fix it...

Edit: Also wanted to add that competitive is filled with cheaters - at the point of adding this I've played 2 competitive matches on Dust2 (because I love this OG map and it is not in the Premier rotation) where the 1st one had an aimlock + wallhack player who did not even care to hide it. The 2nd match a player on the enemy team tilted after losing 7 rounds, toggled wall hack and proceeded to shoot everyone through walls.

That being said, if you're a new player definitely stay away, because you will need to play a lot of competitive matches to unlock premier mode."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than CS:GO somehow.
730;Counter-Strike 2;The gunplay is the worst ive seen in a video game. How do people enjoy this?
730;Counter-Strike 2;No explanation needed XD
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hi, my name is Vlad and I have been playing cs since 2011. First I played cs 1.6, and then I played more than 1000 hours of csgo. Maybe this is not much compared to many players, but for me it is quite a lot. I loved playing csgo. I consider it one of the most influential and best games of its kind. CS has a very ingenious gameplay that will appeal to a lot of people. It has different maps, different modes, and interesting operations from time to time.

And now I, like everyone else, have moved on to cs2 and it's hard to describe my disappointment. According to the developers' idea and the players' expectations, cs2 was supposed to be a step forward. A significant step. Not just a big update. This release was positioned as the release of a new game, but in reality, it turned out to be quite different. 

I do not understand all the nuances of the technical component of the game and I do not have to. I'm speaking my impressions purely as a player, from the experience I've had with the game: everything has become much worse. Not better. And the main problem with this is the lack of development of this project. It's a very crude game with a lot of technical problems. 

And I don't understand the motivation of the Valve at all, and the reasons why they did this. What required such a hasty release, which will obviously be a disappointment for the players? I don't think they are all very stupid there. I think they were well aware that they needed more time to satisfy their fans.

But they acted as if they didn't care at all. And now they're getting well-deserved hate and devastating criticism. It's a real shame for the game, I loved it so much, and now I'm actively looking at alternative projects to enjoy the full gameplay (like many other players)."
730;Counter-Strike 2;R.I.P CSGO
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I've been a Counter-Strike fan since the early days, and I was eagerly anticipating the release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). From the moment I booted up the game, I was blown away by the visuals. The Source 2 engine brings the game's environments and characters to life in stunning detail, and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive.

The gameplay is also top-notch. CS2 retains the core mechanics that have made Counter-Strike a success for over two decades, but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern. The team-based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever, and the game's competitive depth is unmatched.

However, my enjoyment of CS2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating. I've encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches, and it's starting to ruin the experience for me. It's frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks, and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game's competitive nature.

I know that Valve is working on improving VAC, but it doesn't seem to be enough at the moment. Cheating is a serious problem in CS2, and it's something that Valve needs to address as soon as possible.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first-person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren't for the prevalence of cheating."
730;Counter-Strike 2;20 years industry leading PC FPS still has an embarrassing anti cheat
730;Counter-Strike 2;Spoko gierka
730;Counter-Strike 2;A game where you can meet people with different ethnic backgrounds. I jump with ecstasy whenever I interact with this friendly and welcoming community.  A non-toxic diverse community where race, gender and religion has not restrictions. 11/10.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Your team in every random competitive game:

- You
- Russian Guy
- Another Russian Guy
- A 6 year old kid who slept with your mother
- Russian Guy who speaks English"
730;Counter-Strike 2;Awful game. CS:GO was obviously better
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I'm sorry, Valve, but your idea of a CS game s**u**c**k**s a**s**s with a straw.
CS:GO was just fine the way it was.
The only thing it needed was a better anti-cheat system, just like TF2 does... instead you made the game crap. You made me have more fun playing CS 1.6 and that's really saying something.
Tell me, what was wrong with [TEAM] DEATHMATCH? Why does friendly-fire have to be enabled by default in my ex-favorite game mode? I know, right? Why WOULD you concentrate on killing the enemy team? Nooo. Just kill each other. It's much more fun to not be able to even tell what's going on.
Or the gun-game. Or everything else. I had to fiddle around for 15 damn minutes trying to equip my StatTrak weapon - because that is the reason I paid money for it, to use it - until i found out it's a drag-and-drop system, and you can no longer select from a multitude of weapons.
You know what? I want my money back for CS:GO, since the game is no longer in my game library. I don't want this utter crap you replaced it with."
730;Counter-Strike 2;They deleted CSGO for this shIt
730;Counter-Strike 2;Only have russians who dont speak english, are toxic and on shit ping make them their own server.
730;Counter-Strike 2;This may come as a shock to some, but the anti-cheat does not work. Not only does it fail to ban real cheaters, today after loosing a string of games, with a negative and frankly embarrassing kd, I myself was VAC banned. I have never cheated in a video game, no scripts, not a single dodgy download, nada. I don't care that I cant play this shitty game, I care that my reputation is now tarnished because of a false ban. We shall see how customer support deals with this, but somehow I doubt I will get any justice.
730;Counter-Strike 2;My life would've probably improved significantly if I spent those 52.6 hours doing something else
730;Counter-Strike 2;lot of cheaters
730;Counter-Strike 2;give us back csgo. you cant serious expect me to enjoy this game after removing my favorite map (train) and 11 years worth of csgo history. we even found a way to go back to csgo and you removed it just because of a stupid fucking split in the player base?! you could have just made cs2 its own game and give it a better name with new maps, new skins, new gamemodes, you could even add more operations to advance the cs lore and make more money cause it seems like to me thats all your starting to care about valve. dont forget about the fps drops, e.g csgo could run on any computer at good fps but cs2 needs a modern day computer to be playable. better idea, instead of spending all that time making cs2 YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN US A REAL FUCKING UPDATE FOR TF2, HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING VALVE. this whole scenario reminds me of titanfall 2 and apex (apex shoud have been titanfall 3) but i feel that was more ruined by ea. even if i havent played csgo since its release i still know that cs2 is shit. i did learn something from cs2 and that was that earth is the closest planet to the sun, i know that the whole brightness thing was for visibility but still WHY IS IT SO FUCKING BRIGHT, IT LOOKS SO BAD, i cant even fix it ive tried and it just doesnt work, no matter what i do its still bright, can you at least give us an option to make it look like csgo again? im gonna end my rant here because honestly i feel like no matter how much people complain you wont do shit valve, so ill see you all in hell and if you make half life 3 do it on source not source 2, source 2 sucks dick.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"A literal downgrade of CSGO. Gameplay changes, aesthetics etc. all worse than they were.

Other negatives:
-Ui placement and navigation is confusing and overcomplicated.
-By default the crosshair follows the spray pattern wich means your aim will go EVERYWHERE where you arent aiming, making proper shooting even harder unless you mess with a load of settings. This feature is literally confusing and unnecessary.
-The community is literal filth. Nonstop toxic ppl insulting, griefing, teamkilling, shouting and in a single match i heard the n word more than i did in my entire life. (now imagine all of this in every match)
-The anti cheat is technically non existant. 8/10 matches have at least 1 blatant cheater. And thats with the premium ""safe"" matchmaking.
-The amount of russian players has only increased wich HEAVILY increased toxicity.
-Somehow the gunplay feels even more unpredictable and unstable making fights feel as if you have to be lucky to get anything done.

Overall do yourselves a favor and play literally anything else coz this game is literally a waste of time at this point."
730;Counter-Strike 2;"No more map faction playermodels but you can look at your legs :ooooo

730;Counter-Strike 2;"You will get banned for griefing a lot.
This game isn't good for your sanity.

The biggest problem is still the same as in CS:GO, cheaters have easy access to new accounts so the margin never changes. I'm actually thinking about dropping PvP games completely, humankind is cancer."
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Dear Valve,

Please give us CS:GO back. We didn't pay for this pile of hot shit. I bought CS:GO before it was free to play and you have just deleted my game. I don't give a rats ass what your terms of service say, I payed for a good game and you took it away from me. You didn't even have the decency to replace it with something that works or is a finished product.

Also valve, grow a pair. release CS2 as a standalone game alongside CS:GO and let the player numbers speak for themselves. Valve would never do this because then everyone would see that people are playing CS:GO over this trash.

GTFO,
The People who Gave you Money XOXOXO!!!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;dogsht
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 - Even though it's a glorified upgrade. You can't really do much to make the CS formula better. The main modification is the increased dynamic fog that is impacted by nades and gunshots. Otherwise, images now appear literally ""polished""... a tad bit brighter, clearer, less grainy, and warmer. Additionally, the user interface has been improved.

Gameplay wise it is the identical antique, bullet spread appears more random even as shifting however otherwise can not notice something else. however in any other case this update is simply refinement.. do not anticipate some thing to blow you out of the water.

730;Counter-Strike 2;CHEATERS EVERYWHERE
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Same game as CSGO but no net_graph, replay or wheel

Lag and stutter increased"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This is difficult for me to write because I have always loved CS, back in the 1.6 days and moving forward into Source and although I never transitioned into CS:Go, I did come back for CS2, albeit with a far diminished skill set, reduced reflexes and far less hours to 'get gud' again.

Here is where the problems start.  I get that im not so good, i die far more often then i get a kill, but does this justify being abused in a match?  Amongst other things, I have been abused due to my race and disability, and its horrendous getting these verbals thrown at you because you are not as good as others.  I have kick votes made against me - because im not as good.  This abuse has been in competitive and casual, in fact i stick to casual now as i realise im crap and dont want to impact peoples 'competitive' stats.

So why the negative review?  
1) Bots dont help me close the competitive gap.  I am stuck in no mans land - not good enough for online and playing offline with bots I go through a match without dying and have top kills.  The bots are not hard enough to push the gap between offline and online.

2) Ranking - the game is putting me with players clearly superior to myself which is frustrating for both parties.  Why are there not official 'noob friendly' servers or a ranking system that works to separate out good from bad players?

3) Toxic players - The vast majority of players are fine but the vitriol from the minority ruin the matches in which they are present."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Ta com cheater demais, não ta dando, vou dar uma pausa de 3 meses, boa sorte.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Its 2024... This game might be a ""Staple"" because everyone has played it for the past 25 years, but it's not offering anything original, new, or a new perspective on the subject. It's just the good old same game, just with upgraded graphics. So, of course, if you are nostalgic, or if you feel that investing time in another game might be to much, or if you just want to fall into your old shoes for the sake of not feeling any discomfort from evolving to something new, please continue playing this game.

In the end I recommend to people who just want to stay in 1999.

I don't recommend to anyone who hasn't played the game non stop for the past 25 years... it just feels comfortable like very outdated, dirty, old slippers."
730;Counter-Strike 2;I am just glad they finally fixed this bug that causing constant packet loss. Well, actually the packet loss is still there, except the video stream is smooth now so I don't feel as much.
730;Counter-Strike 2;its a fun game. you have about a 90% chance of running into toxic lobbies and players but if you have your viop down to 0 it makes those lobbies bearable, you can also actually hear footsteps and stuff better instead of people just yelling at each other as well with it set to that.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Play cs 2 (5 hour), NICE GAME in the WORLD =)
730;Counter-Strike 2;BETTER THAN VALORANT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Really cannot understand how they got the gun mechanics so bad in this historically famous gun game, as someone who was reasonably high rank in CSGO back in the day, and enjoyed the game, I would say this game has the worst gun play of all the major FPS games. How many times do you do 20dmg in 8 shots at point blank range or have your cross hairs on a target, continue to hold crosshairs on target only to find out you hit them once or not at all.
- Horrible Gun play
- Horrible Audio (no idea what they have done but you can now hear everyone on the map)
- Horrible optimisation
- Removed a lot of enjoyable classic maps
- Game feels rushed for a game that's been like a decade in the making.
+ I can make a significant amount of steam bucks for selling my inventory.

Really enjoy watching the game but cannot stand playing this game again and that's not even considering the Russian kids as team mates."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Game just needs to bring back surf or just workshop maps back in general
730;Counter-Strike 2;yeah this game has worse match making than c.o.d, i have 50 hours in this game and i'm being put in games with smurfs with  over 1800, 2k, 3k hours and i just get steamrolled. if youre new to this game like i am just dont play, bc i made the mistake of paying for premier and you have to be at level 10. getting to level 10 is taking roughly about 60 hours of just rage gaming and it sucks. dont pay for it. go play valorant or something bc this game is not where its at. this is a horrible time for new players till valve stop sucking.
730;Counter-Strike 2;bring back csgo
730;Counter-Strike 2;Maaaan...As a Solo Q player who really tried hard for improving and ranking to the top i strongly left with the feeling that every second game someone abandones the match and by 90% it's has to be from my team..As i used to track my performance which numbers were good it turned out that from 27 losses in a month 19 were due to an abandoned teammate.It's just so sad and annoying which made me unistall the game for a 3 month period. After the release of CS2 came back again..2 played games 2 times  abandoned teammate..hell nooo...

Hmm, OK my plan: I'll buy CS2 and I don't need to play it, because they haven't patched in the rear sight and front sight yet, and concentrate me on the awesomeness of the loot boxes. Still had €39 credit on Steam. No sooner said than done - spent over €14 on CS2 and then bought 12 weapon boxes. Bought a special box that cost €4.65. You don't treat yourself to anything else. :) Steam account plundered down to the last cent, and generally empty again anyway. Well, the next day, today! I start the game full of expectation and virginity. First check the graphics, adjust the buttons, see what else is available...Ok, now it's time to get down to business - the weapon boxes with my top loot. I know myself, I'm a lucky guy. (: Opened the hottest box, a noise sounds - lol? I still need a ******* key to open it?? €2.46/loot box key? oO
Product key refunded. Refundet? lol² - This product is non-refundable. Further information

Dude. Really? I'm looking completely stupid now. This pisses me off. :/"

730;Counter-Strike 2;Cs2 is so broken compared to cs:go. For example the ranking system is full of shit and the gun spray (e.g ak47) is destroyed. Also there is so easy to get headshot while running or jumping. I really hope so that the Valve repairing the game completely. Valve has been make several updates for repairing the issues and functionalities after the game is published. But still there is so many issues or even some functionality missing.. The game has been published too early! What the hell. There nothing to good to say.. ouh well the graphics is better. Hell yeah!

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients for four people:
Chicken fillet 400 g
Parsley 50 g
Pickled cucumber 6
Potatoes (optional) 2
Pita bread 4 (or as needed)
Olive oil 3 tbsp
Onion 1
Parmesan cheese 100 g
Salt 2 tbsp
Turmeric 1 tsp
Ground black pepper 2 tsp
Garlic powder 2 tsp

Ingredients for tahini sauce:
Thick yogurt 4 tbsp
Mayonnaise 1 tbsp
Tahini 1 tbsp
Fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
Garlic 1
Salt 1 tsp (or to taste)
Ground black pepper ½ tsp (or to taste)

Wash the chicken fillet, take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips. Add them to a mixing bowl.

Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.

Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This game got replaced. The reviews are from cs:go which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.

CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in cs:go.
This game is incomplete and shouldn't take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully.
New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn't worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but it's not ready to replace CS: GO and they shouldn't remove an existing game and turn off CS:GO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.

I feel scammed especially that I bought CS:GO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake."

730;Counter-Strike 2;my pc too potato to run this now
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being it's own game.

CS2's implementation of the networking system, ""Subtick"", is god fucking awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.

The aggravating meme of Ferrari peeks is ridiculous and there is no humanly way to fight someone that either doesn't appear on your screen until you are already dead, getting fucked by ghosts seemingly or seeing them for a fraction of a second giving the same outcome.

Playing against teams that just rush with P90's is like getting brutally ass fucked by a rusty, unlubed, bad dragon dildo without consent or courtesy to spit first which you are powerless to stop...unless you stop playing. It's even worse with peekers advantage being so bad that if you are even a semi-decent shot, someone with an AK-47 will be hitting your power off button more times than a retarded monkey in an IT shop.

Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrum's (network and performance) has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.

Change your beta branch to CSGO and wait a very fucking long time to play this garbage. Infuriating is the kindest way you could call the CS2 experience."

730;Counter-Strike 2;I paid for CS:GO once. Not CS2. Where is my game?
730;Counter-Strike 2;I appreciate the upgrade in fidelity, but I really miss Arms Race, Danger Zone,... which allowed me to practice CS in a fun way. I'm not a 100% hardcore dude, and since I can't play CSGO anymore I really feel like I can spend my time better with other games.
730;Counter-Strike 2;I'd like to play CSGO please.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Nobody reads reviews anyway, so I'll write that I'm a nice person

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Finally the timeless Counter Strike got an update. Playing since Beta 7.1 through all iterations more or less active.
The best competitive shooter on the market. I like the changes to ingame skins, they look amazing with the new update. Sub-Tickrate improvement is as well great. Easy to play hard to master.

Negative:
- Anti Cheat software does not work as intended, too many cheaters in game 
- No regional server limitations (flooded with griefing, cheating, unfriendly player communities from the eastern part of Europe)
- Still some bugs with hitbox registration in-game
- New ranking system for matchmaking and premier is not balanced and is not motivating due to issues with point distribution

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Okay listen, life gets shorter and shorter every year. I have no free time with trying to afford my $2,500 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment while getting $15.25 an hour from serving at Lowes. This game makes me not have fun at the end of the night. I am never happy after a three hour session of CSGO ""2"". In fact, I now have high blood pressure at the ripe age of 26. I could have painted a painting, or learned to play the mandolin, or built a meaningful and supportive relationship. This game does not allow that. Save yourself. Save you. Today and Tomorrow and Tomorrow's Tomorrow."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cancerous piece of shit game, terrible movement and gun control compared to CSGO, shitty premier matchmaking that likes to put you in very unbalanced matches, no new maps and game modes as promised, the only thing it has over CSGO is that it looks better, come back when they fix this shit
730;Counter-Strike 2;Got banned from anticheat when i dont even know how to use cheats, in a normal competitive match playing with a friend who just started, anticheat is broken. When its many hackers and you ban the people who is playing without cheats.
730;Counter-Strike 2;So with every change there is turbulence and it's understandable that people in the pro scene get angry at sub-ticks, or lag-input or whatever the hell it is. But from the perspective of a 2k person, this upgrade is just bad, like there's no fucking way around it. There wasn't even a point in time where i doubted myself or tried to backtrack to check if i contradicted myself on some minor issues I've experienced. What's weird is that the issues themselves aren't even technical in their nature (for the most part), it's the fact that spray patterns have been tinkered with & it seems Valve fucked up the pacing and the models as well. Sometimes when i shoot at a person at point blank range i couldn't even fucking hs him even if my aim was dead-on and i wasn't moving, other times when i get kills from far away with ridiculously improbable angle whilst bursting where the person didn't even see me and wasn't peeking at all. Every single thing that wasn't an issue in cs:go became an issue now.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Better bring back cs go.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than Source.

730;Counter-Strike 2;Terrible game! CS:GO was miles better. Matchmaking, cheaters/hackers, gun play, tick rate, etc. got even worse than in CG:GO like HOW!!! PLEASE BRING CS:GO BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!
730;Counter-Strike 2;They removed arms race, there is no reason for me to keep this game on my computer.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cheaters in every single match
730;Counter-Strike 2;I cannot believe i have spent 944 fucking hours thinking that i could possibly enjoy this game at any point. This is a prime example of the industrial revolution and its consequences and i could have spent that 1k hours doing something so much more important. Absolute waste of fucking time, fuck this game, and fuck you for playing it
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I really love CS, but at the state CS2 is now - I can't recommend this to anyone.
Subtick is terrible, sounds are trash (compared to what they were on CSGO) and the premier mm system is terrible (I'm convinced that a monkey wrote the algorithm)

Stay away from this for like 6 months, they might fix it...

Edit: Also wanted to add that competitive is filled with cheaters - at the point of adding this I've played 2 competitive matches on Dust2 (because I love this OG map and it is not in the Premier rotation) where the 1st one had an aimlock + wallhack player who did not even care to hide it. The 2nd match a player on the enemy team tilted after losing 7 rounds, toggled wall hack and proceeded to shoot everyone through walls.

That being said, if you're a new player definitely stay away, because you will need to play a lot of competitive matches to unlock premier mode."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than CS:GO somehow.
730;Counter-Strike 2;The gunplay is the worst ive seen in a video game. How do people enjoy this?
730;Counter-Strike 2;No explanation needed XD
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hi, my name is Vlad and I have been playing cs since 2011. First I played cs 1.6, and then I played more than 1000 hours of csgo. Maybe this is not much compared to many players, but for me it is quite a lot. I loved playing csgo. I consider it one of the most influential and best games of its kind. CS has a very ingenious gameplay that will appeal to a lot of people. It has different maps, different modes, and interesting operations from time to time.

And now I, like everyone else, have moved on to cs2 and it's hard to describe my disappointment. According to the developers' idea and the players' expectations, cs2 was supposed to be a step forward. A significant step. Not just a big update. This release was positioned as the release of a new game, but in reality, it turned out to be quite different. 

I do not understand all the nuances of the technical component of the game and I do not have to. I'm speaking my impressions purely as a player, from the experience I've had with the game: everything has become much worse. Not better. And the main problem with this is the lack of development of this project. It's a very crude game with a lot of technical problems. 

And I don't understand the motivation of the Valve at all, and the reasons why they did this. What required such a hasty release, which will obviously be a disappointment for the players? I don't think they are all very stupid there. I think they were well aware that they needed more time to satisfy their fans.

But they acted as if they didn't care at all. And now they're getting well-deserved hate and devastating criticism. It's a real shame for the game, I loved it so much, and now I'm actively looking at alternative projects to enjoy the full gameplay (like many other players)."
730;Counter-Strike 2;R.I.P CSGO
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I've been a Counter-Strike fan since the early days, and I was eagerly anticipating the release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). From the moment I booted up the game, I was blown away by the visuals. The Source 2 engine brings the game's environments and characters to life in stunning detail, and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive.

The gameplay is also top-notch. CS2 retains the core mechanics that have made Counter-Strike a success for over two decades, but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern. The team-based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever, and the game's competitive depth is unmatched.

However, my enjoyment of CS2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating. I've encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches, and it's starting to ruin the experience for me. It's frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks, and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game's competitive nature.

I know that Valve is working on improving VAC, but it doesn't seem to be enough at the moment. Cheating is a serious problem in CS2, and it's something that Valve needs to address as soon as possible.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first-person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren't for the prevalence of cheating."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Awful game. CS:GO was obviously better
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I'm sorry, Valve, but your idea of a CS game s**u**c**k**s a**s**s with a straw.
CS:GO was just fine the way it was.
The only thing it needed was a better anti-cheat system, just like TF2 does... instead you made the game crap. You made me have more fun playing CS 1.6 and that's really saying something.
Tell me, what was wrong with [TEAM] DEATHMATCH? Why does friendly-fire have to be enabled by default in my ex-favorite game mode? I know, right? Why WOULD you concentrate on killing the enemy team? Nooo. Just kill each other. It's much more fun to not be able to even tell what's going on.
Or the gun-game. Or everything else. I had to fiddle around for 15 damn minutes trying to equip my StatTrak weapon - because that is the reason I paid money for it, to use it - until i found out it's a drag-and-drop system, and you can no longer select from a multitude of weapons.
You know what? I want my money back for CS:GO, since the game is no longer in my game library. I don't want this utter crap you replaced it with."
730;Counter-Strike 2;They deleted CSGO for this shIt
730;Counter-Strike 2;Only have russians who dont speak english, are toxic and on shit ping make them their own server.
730;Counter-Strike 2;This may come as a shock to some, but the anti-cheat does not work. Not only does it fail to ban real cheaters, today after loosing a string of games, with a negative and frankly embarrassing kd, I myself was VAC banned. I have never cheated in a video game, no scripts, not a single dodgy download, nada. I don't care that I cant play this shitty game, I care that my reputation is now tarnished because of a false ban. We shall see how customer support deals with this, but somehow I doubt I will get any justice.
730;Counter-Strike 2;My life would've probably improved significantly if I spent those 52.6 hours doing something else
730;Counter-Strike 2;lot of cheaters
730;Counter-Strike 2;give us back csgo. you cant serious expect me to enjoy this game after removing my favorite map (train) and 11 years worth of csgo history. we even found a way to go back to csgo and you removed it just because of a stupid fucking split in the player base?! you could have just made cs2 its own game and give it a better name with new maps, new skins, new gamemodes, you could even add more operations to advance the cs lore and make more money cause it seems like to me thats all your starting to care about valve. dont forget about the fps drops, e.g csgo could run on any computer at good fps but cs2 needs a modern day computer to be playable. better idea, instead of spending all that time making cs2 YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN US A REAL FUCKING UPDATE FOR TF2, HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING VALVE. this whole scenario reminds me of titanfall 2 and apex (apex shoud have been titanfall 3) but i feel that was more ruined by ea. even if i havent played csgo since its release i still know that cs2 is shit. i did learn something from cs2 and that was that earth is the closest planet to the sun, i know that the whole brightness thing was for visibility but still WHY IS IT SO FUCKING BRIGHT, IT LOOKS SO BAD, i cant even fix it ive tried and it just doesnt work, no matter what i do its still bright, can you at least give us an option to make it look like csgo again? im gonna end my rant here because honestly i feel like no matter how much people complain you wont do shit valve, so ill see you all in hell and if you make half life 3 do it on source not source 2, source 2 sucks dick.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"A literal downgrade of CSGO. Gameplay changes, aesthetics etc. all worse than they were.

Other negatives:
-Ui placement and navigation is confusing and overcomplicated.
-By default the crosshair follows the spray pattern wich means your aim will go EVERYWHERE where you arent aiming, making proper shooting even harder unless you mess with a load of settings. This feature is literally confusing and unnecessary.
-The community is literal filth. Nonstop toxic ppl insulting, griefing, teamkilling, shouting and in a single match i heard the n word more than i did in my entire life. (now imagine all of this in every match)
-The anti cheat is technically non existant. 8/10 matches have at least 1 blatant cheater. And thats with the premium ""safe"" matchmaking.
-The amount of russian players has only increased wich HEAVILY increased toxicity.
-Somehow the gunplay feels even more unpredictable and unstable making fights feel as if you have to be lucky to get anything done.

Overall do yourselves a favor and play literally anything else coz this game is literally a waste of time at this point."

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 - Even though it's a glorified upgrade. You can't really do much to make the CS formula better. The main modification is the increased dynamic fog that is impacted by nades and gunshots. Otherwise, images now appear literally ""polished""... a tad bit brighter, clearer, less grainy, and warmer. Additionally, the user interface has been improved.

Gameplay wise it is the identical antique, bullet spread appears more random even as shifting however otherwise can not notice something else. however in any other case this update is simply refinement.. do not anticipate some thing to blow you out of the water.

730;Counter-Strike 2;8/10
730;Counter-Strike 2;great game i love the competitive aspect however it feels a bit different to csgo
730;Counter-Strike 2;+
730;Counter-Strike 2;runs much worst then csgo, forced update is stupid
730;Counter-Strike 2;i need help.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Very relaxing game, especially after jumping off a plane and wrestling with a kangaroo
730;Counter-Strike 2;Its ok
730;Counter-Strike 2;What can you even say about this game. It's the greatest competitive team shooter ever.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Good Game
730;Counter-Strike 2;CHEATERS EVERYWHERE
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Same game as CSGO but no net_graph, replay or wheel

Lag and stutter increased"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This is difficult for me to write because I have always loved CS, back in the 1.6 days and moving forward into Source and although I never transitioned into CS:Go, I did come back for CS2, albeit with a far diminished skill set, reduced reflexes and far less hours to 'get gud' again.

Here is where the problems start.  I get that im not so good, i die far more often then i get a kill, but does this justify being abused in a match?  Amongst other things, I have been abused due to my race and disability, and its horrendous getting these verbals thrown at you because you are not as good as others.  I have kick votes made against me - because im not as good.  This abuse has been in competitive and casual, in fact i stick to casual now as i realise im crap and dont want to impact peoples 'competitive' stats.

So why the negative review?  
1) Bots dont help me close the competitive gap.  I am stuck in no mans land - not good enough for online and playing offline with bots I go through a match without dying and have top kills.  The bots are not hard enough to push the gap between offline and online.

2) Ranking - the game is putting me with players clearly superior to myself which is frustrating for both parties.  Why are there not official 'noob friendly' servers or a ranking system that works to separate out good from bad players?

3) Toxic players - The vast majority of players are fine but the vitriol from the minority ruin the matches in which they are present."

730;Counter-Strike 2;Terrible rework. Bring back CS:GO.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Ta com cheater demais, não ta dando, vou dar uma pausa de 3 meses, boa sorte.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Its 2024... This game might be a ""Staple"" because everyone has played it for the past 25 years, but it's not offering anything original, new, or a new perspective on the subject. It's just the good old same game, just with upgraded graphics. So, of course, if you are nostalgic, or if you feel that investing time in another game might be to much, or if you just want to fall into your old shoes for the sake of not feeling any discomfort from evolving to something new, please continue playing this game.

In the end I recommend to people who just want to stay in 1999.

I don't recommend to anyone who hasn't played the game non stop for the past 25 years... it just feels comfortable like very outdated, dirty, old slippers."
730;Counter-Strike 2;I am just glad they finally fixed this bug that causing constant packet loss. Well, actually the packet loss is still there, except the video stream is smooth now so I don't feel as much.
730;Counter-Strike 2;its a fun game. you have about a 90% chance of running into toxic lobbies and players but if you have your viop down to 0 it makes those lobbies bearable, you can also actually hear footsteps and stuff better instead of people just yelling at each other as well with it set to that.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Play cs 2 (5 hour), NICE GAME in the WORLD =)
730;Counter-Strike 2;BETTER THAN VALORANT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Really cannot understand how they got the gun mechanics so bad in this historically famous gun game, as someone who was reasonably high rank in CSGO back in the day, and enjoyed the game, I would say this game has the worst gun play of all the major FPS games. How many times do you do 20dmg in 8 shots at point blank range or have your cross hairs on a target, continue to hold crosshairs on target only to find out you hit them once or not at all.
- Horrible Gun play
- Horrible Audio (no idea what they have done but you can now hear everyone on the map)
- Horrible optimisation
- Removed a lot of enjoyable classic maps
- Game feels rushed for a game that's been like a decade in the making.
+ I can make a significant amount of steam bucks for selling my inventory.

Really enjoy watching the game but cannot stand playing this game again and that's not even considering the Russian kids as team mates."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Game just needs to bring back surf or just workshop maps back in general
730;Counter-Strike 2;yeah this game has worse match making than c.o.d, i have 50 hours in this game and i'm being put in games with smurfs with  over 1800, 2k, 3k hours and i just get steamrolled. if youre new to this game like i am just dont play, bc i made the mistake of paying for premier and you have to be at level 10. getting to level 10 is taking roughly about 60 hours of just rage gaming and it sucks. dont pay for it. go play valorant or something bc this game is not where its at. this is a horrible time for new players till valve stop sucking.
730;Counter-Strike 2;bring back csgo
730;Counter-Strike 2;Maaaan...As a Solo Q player who really tried hard for improving and ranking to the top i strongly left with the feeling that every second game someone abandones the match and by 90% it's has to be from my team..As i used to track my performance which numbers were good it turned out that from 27 losses in a month 19 were due to an abandoned teammate.It's just so sad and annoying which made me unistall the game for a 3 month period. After the release of CS2 came back again..2 played games 2 times  abandoned teammate..hell nooo...
730;Counter-Strike 2;csgo better :)
730;Counter-Strike 2;7.7 billion dollar company cant afford 128 tic server costs. Riot clearly cares more about their players than Valve. Inexcusable greed, garbage gaming experience, dead game

730;Counter-Strike 2;there is feet now. me big like feet

""It looks like you've already filed a report against this person."" 
Months of cheating with no ban xDDDDDDD"
730;Counter-Strike 2;csgo > cs2
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 is like the world's most perfect saltine cracker. 

It's absolutely flawless. There's nothing wrong with it. It is the perfection of the thing it sets out to do.

But in the end, it's still just a saltine cracker--no flavor, no spice, no soul. 

So... it's fine. But there are more interesting things to put your mouth on."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Prime enabled account and cant play a single game without a wall hacker or aim hacker. Game is great but the fact that the anti cheat still doesnt work for shit blows my mind. Lets release a new game with zero fixes to the anti cheat. Game will always be full of scammers and cheaters. 10/10 would not recommend.
730;Counter-Strike 2;More Power to CS!
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worth it.

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Haven't seen a clean player in weeks. Everywhere you play it's just third worlders wasting all day cheating as 4-5 premades.
They will just abuse the report system on everyone and get you banned up to 2 weeks for absolutely no reason. None of the bans are checked for validity, just reach a threshold = ban.

Do not play this unless you cheat.
And if you cheat, well, I can't tell you what to do without getting banned from here."

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hey, I've never played CS in any form in my life. Only Frontlines, Call of Duty or Battlefield. Lately I've been seeing YouTubers opening CS2 boxes with valuable contents and selling the stuff off. Some have 1K prices. Hmm, OK my plan: I'll buy CS2 and I don't need to play it, because they haven't patched in the rear sight and front sight yet, and concentrate me on the awesomeness of the loot boxes. Still had €39 credit on Steam. No sooner said than done - spent over €14 on CS2 and then bought 12 weapon boxes. Bought a special box that cost €4.65. You don't treat yourself to anything else. :) Steam account plundered down to the last cent, and generally empty again anyway. Well, the next day, today! I start the game full of expectation and virginity. First check the graphics, adjust the buttons, see what else is available...Ok, now it's time to get down to business - the weapon boxes with my top loot. I know myself, I'm a lucky guy. (: Opened the hottest box, a noise sounds - lol? I still need a ******* key to open it?? €2.46/loot box key? oO
Product key refunded. Refundet? lol² - This product is non-refundable. Further information

Dude. Really? I'm looking completely stupid now. This pisses me off. :/"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I normally don't write reviews but what an absolute shit show of a system. You can report enemy/team mates ""griefing"" to get them suspended. AUTOMATED system once report count hits. 2023 in-game report system designed by interns.

730;Counter-Strike 2;"ok first off cs:go was good i never played it as much as i did 1.6 or source, but cs:2 is a lag simulator i have adjusted my max ping to 70 and below and it is totally unplayable, i play tarkov at 180 fps, arma 3 at 260 fps mw3 at 120 fps, im lucky if i get 5 fps in counter strike 2, the recommended settings are set to high, i even tried lowering them to medium, low to test and literally even with my ping set to 40 max - still totally unplayable. my average fps in an hour of playing just before i wrote this was 10.5 fps - server stability was a joke even with my ping settings yet i have no problems playing ANY THING ELSE  ON HIGH OR ULTRA SETTINGS AT 1080p but cs:2 is a complete joke

730;Counter-Strike 2;Valve killed game :(
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cs2 is so broken compared to cs:go. For example the ranking system is full of shit and the gun spray (e.g ak47) is destroyed. Also there is so easy to get headshot while running or jumping. I really hope so that the Valve repairing the game completely. Valve has been make several updates for repairing the issues and functionalities after the game is published. But still there is so many issues or even some functionality missing.. The game has been published too early! What the hell. There nothing to good to say.. ouh well the graphics is better. Hell yeah!
730;Counter-Strike 2;same terrible game
730;Counter-Strike 2;Whoever thought having vote kick in a game mostly played by 13 year olds is a good idea needs to be banned from the game like me after being vote kicked twice for no reason.

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Chicken Shawarma

Ingredients for four people:
Chicken fillet 400 g
Parsley 50 g
Pickled cucumber 6
Potatoes (optional) 2
Pita bread 4 (or as needed)
Olive oil 3 tbsp
Onion 1
Parmesan cheese 100 g
Salt 2 tbsp
Turmeric 1 tsp
Ground black pepper 2 tsp
Garlic powder 2 tsp

Ingredients for tahini sauce:
Thick yogurt 4 tbsp
Mayonnaise 1 tbsp
Tahini 1 tbsp
Fresh lemon juice 3 tbsp
Garlic 1
Salt 1 tsp (or to taste)
Ground black pepper ½ tsp (or to taste)

Wash the chicken fillet, take the chicken skin off and slice them into strips. Add them to a mixing bowl.

Mix up the salt, turmeric, black pepper, and garlic powder. Add them along with the olive oil to the Chicken and massage the seasoning into the chicken fillets.

Cut the onion into slices and add them to the Chicken. Mix everything together.

Cover the Chicken with a plastic film and let it sit in the fridge for at least an hour. Chilling the mixture will marinate the Chicken and infuse it with flavor.

While the Chicken is marinating, prepare the tahini sauce. For this purpose, pour the thick yogurt with mayonnaise, tahini, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper into a suitable bowl.

Finely grate the garlic and add it to the bowl. Then mix until the sauce is uniform. Note that the sauce should be as thick as porridge.

Now put a suitable pan on low heat and coat it with oil. Once the oil is hot enough, add the marinated chicken fillets into the pan and sauté until the fillets change color.

Meanwhile, you can fry the potatoes. Slice the potato lengthwise to your desired thickness.

Put a pan on the heat and add two to three tablespoons of oil. Then fry the potatoes in oil over medium heat until they get golden.

Wash the parsley and drain the excess water. Now transfer them to a tray and chop them finely.

Place the pita bread on your tray. Take the tahini sauce and spread it on the center of the bread.

Pile a layer of the chicken fillets, fried potatoes, chopped pickles, parsley, and a sprinkle of parmesan cheese on the bread and roll it. You can top the ingredient with tahini sauce if you like.

At this stage, preheat the sandwich maker, then roast the shawarmas in the machine. In the absence of a sandwich maker, place an unoiled grill pan on medium heat and put the shawarmas in the pan. Then put a heavy object on them to grill them thoroughly.

Once the shawarmas are roasted, and the bread is crispy, cut them in half and put them in your desired dish. You do not have to eat shawarma with bread if you want to stay away from carbohydrates, and you can serve them with salad or plain.

Enjoy your meal!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"This game got replaced. The reviews are from cs:go which was a way better game. They replaced it in steam to steal positive reviews and players from a good game.

CS 2 has a slightly improved graphics but they removed most of the maps, community servers, battle royale, surf, zombies mods and more. Additionally new servers are lagging hard and there are days when I cannot play at all which never happened in cs:go.
This game is incomplete and shouldn't take place of an existing game with existing community if it cannot replace it fully.
New graphics are not even that good and definitely the upgrade wasn't worth it. I was hyped for CS 2 but it's not ready to replace CS: GO and they shouldn't remove an existing game and turn off CS:GO servers, it should be just a separate game as it always was with CS series.

I feel scammed especially that I bought CS:GO when it was still a paid game. They took a game I paid for and replaced with some silly remake."

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Thanks to CSGO ..

- .. I have met people who can look through walls
- .. I have met people who can turn around quickly
- .. my neighbors hate me

730;Counter-Strike 2;my pc too potato to run this now
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 has been rushed into live compounded by the moronic decision to replace CSGO completely instead of being it's own game.

CS2's implementation of the networking system, ""Subtick"", is god fucking awful and in my opinion is vastly inferior to CSGO. I have never felt like I have no idea where my bullets are going until CS2. I can be dead on some one with my crosshairs, steady stance, unload a mag in precise bursts and the server reports zero hits. There have been plenty of clear blatant examples of poor hit rig with people shooting point blank on someone not moving and still missing, just watching the bullets go right through them.

The aggravating meme of Ferrari peeks is ridiculous and there is no humanly way to fight someone that either doesn't appear on your screen until you are already dead, getting fucked by ghosts seemingly or seeing them for a fraction of a second giving the same outcome.

Playing against teams that just rush with P90's is like getting brutally ass fucked by a rusty, unlubed, bad dragon dildo without consent or courtesy to spit first which you are powerless to stop...unless you stop playing. It's even worse with peekers advantage being so bad that if you are even a semi-decent shot, someone with an AK-47 will be hitting your power off button more times than a retarded monkey in an IT shop.

Lets not get started on the fact that what replaced a playable CSGO on all spectrum's (network and performance) has been replaced with a very poorly optimised mess that requires a top-end PC to have even semi-decent FPS. While with CSGO you could have a relatively low-end system and still play at reasonable FPS - now this eldritch monstrosity will sap every ounce of power from your rig and cry out for more.

Change your beta branch to CSGO and wait a very fucking long time to play this garbage. Infuriating is the kindest way you could call the CS2 experience."
730;Counter-Strike 2;chess for school shooters
730;Counter-Strike 2;My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on CS2 and it gets 350 likes and 150 Awards that he will buy me a case of vodka, some vodka, and bottle of vodka.. So I'm just gonna leave this here.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Removing CS:GO and not even offering a macOS version of CS2 is outrageous. Now I can't play at all.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Shoulda left cs:go available
730;Counter-Strike 2;I paid for CS:GO once. Not CS2. Where is my game?
730;Counter-Strike 2;I appreciate the upgrade in fidelity, but I really miss Arms Race, Danger Zone,... which allowed me to practice CS in a fun way. I'm not a 100% hardcore dude, and since I can't play CSGO anymore I really feel like I can spend my time better with other games.
730;Counter-Strike 2;I'd like to play CSGO please.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Nobody reads reviews anyway, so I'll write that I'm a nice person
730;Counter-Strike 2;NICE ANTICHEAT
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Finally the timeless Counter Strike got an update. Playing since Beta 7.1 through all iterations more or less active.
The best competitive shooter on the market. I like the changes to ingame skins, they look amazing with the new update. Sub-Tickrate improvement is as well great. Easy to play hard to master.

Negative:
- Anti Cheat software does not work as intended, too many cheaters in game 
- No regional server limitations (flooded with griefing, cheating, unfriendly player communities from the eastern part of Europe)
- Still some bugs with hitbox registration in-game
- New ranking system for matchmaking and premier is not balanced and is not motivating due to issues with point distribution
"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Okay listen, life gets shorter and shorter every year. I have no free time with trying to afford my $2,500 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment while getting $15.25 an hour from serving at Lowes. This game makes me not have fun at the end of the night. I am never happy after a three hour session of CSGO ""2"". In fact, I now have high blood pressure at the ripe age of 26. I could have painted a painting, or learned to play the mandolin, or built a meaningful and supportive relationship. This game does not allow that. Save yourself. Save you. Today and Tomorrow and Tomorrow's Tomorrow."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cancerous piece of shit game, terrible movement and gun control compared to CSGO, shitty premier matchmaking that likes to put you in very unbalanced matches, no new maps and game modes as promised, the only thing it has over CSGO is that it looks better, come back when they fix this shit
730;Counter-Strike 2;Got banned from anticheat when i dont even know how to use cheats, in a normal competitive match playing with a friend who just started, anticheat is broken. When its many hackers and you ban the people who is playing without cheats.
730;Counter-Strike 2;So with every change there is turbulence and it's understandable that people in the pro scene get angry at sub-ticks, or lag-input or whatever the hell it is. But from the perspective of a 2k person, this upgrade is just bad, like there's no fucking way around it. There wasn't even a point in time where i doubted myself or tried to backtrack to check if i contradicted myself on some minor issues I've experienced. What's weird is that the issues themselves aren't even technical in their nature (for the most part), it's the fact that spray patterns have been tinkered with & it seems Valve fucked up the pacing and the models as well. Sometimes when i shoot at a person at point blank range i couldn't even fucking hs him even if my aim was dead-on and i wasn't moving, other times when i get kills from far away with ridiculously improbable angle whilst bursting where the person didn't even see me and wasn't peeking at all. Every single thing that wasn't an issue in cs:go became an issue now.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Better bring back cs go.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than Source.
730;Counter-Strike 2;im fat
730;Counter-Strike 2;Lol no
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Banning legit players while doing nothing about real cheaters and even rewarding them.
Great job Valve!"
730;Counter-Strike 2;Terrible game! CS:GO was miles better. Matchmaking, cheaters/hackers, gun play, tick rate, etc. got even worse than in CG:GO like HOW!!! PLEASE BRING CS:GO BACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!
730;Counter-Strike 2;They removed arms race, there is no reason for me to keep this game on my computer.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Cheaters in every single match
730;Counter-Strike 2;I cannot believe i have spent 944 fucking hours thinking that i could possibly enjoy this game at any point. This is a prime example of the industrial revolution and its consequences and i could have spent that 1k hours doing something so much more important. Absolute waste of fucking time, fuck this game, and fuck you for playing it
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I really love CS, but at the state CS2 is now - I can't recommend this to anyone.
Subtick is terrible, sounds are trash (compared to what they were on CSGO) and the premier mm system is terrible (I'm convinced that a monkey wrote the algorithm)

Stay away from this for like 6 months, they might fix it...

Edit: Also wanted to add that competitive is filled with cheaters - at the point of adding this I've played 2 competitive matches on Dust2 (because I love this OG map and it is not in the Premier rotation) where the 1st one had an aimlock + wallhack player who did not even care to hide it. The 2nd match a player on the enemy team tilted after losing 7 rounds, toggled wall hack and proceeded to shoot everyone through walls.

That being said, if you're a new player definitely stay away, because you will need to play a lot of competitive matches to unlock premier mode."
730;Counter-Strike 2;Worse than CS:GO somehow.
730;Counter-Strike 2;The gunplay is the worst ive seen in a video game. How do people enjoy this?
730;Counter-Strike 2;No explanation needed XD
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Hi, my name is Vlad and I have been playing cs since 2011. First I played cs 1.6, and then I played more than 1000 hours of csgo. Maybe this is not much compared to many players, but for me it is quite a lot. I loved playing csgo. I consider it one of the most influential and best games of its kind. CS has a very ingenious gameplay that will appeal to a lot of people. It has different maps, different modes, and interesting operations from time to time.

And now I, like everyone else, have moved on to cs2 and it's hard to describe my disappointment. According to the developers' idea and the players' expectations, cs2 was supposed to be a step forward. A significant step. Not just a big update. This release was positioned as the release of a new game, but in reality, it turned out to be quite different. 

I do not understand all the nuances of the technical component of the game and I do not have to. I'm speaking my impressions purely as a player, from the experience I've had with the game: everything has become much worse. Not better. And the main problem with this is the lack of development of this project. It's a very crude game with a lot of technical problems. 

And I don't understand the motivation of the Valve at all, and the reasons why they did this. What required such a hasty release, which will obviously be a disappointment for the players? I don't think they are all very stupid there. I think they were well aware that they needed more time to satisfy their fans.

But they acted as if they didn't care at all. And now they're getting well-deserved hate and devastating criticism. It's a real shame for the game, I loved it so much, and now I'm actively looking at alternative projects to enjoy the full gameplay (like many other players)."
730;Counter-Strike 2;R.I.P CSGO
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I've been a Counter-Strike fan since the early days, and I was eagerly anticipating the release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). From the moment I booted up the game, I was blown away by the visuals. The Source 2 engine brings the game's environments and characters to life in stunning detail, and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive.

The gameplay is also top-notch. CS2 retains the core mechanics that have made Counter-Strike a success for over two decades, but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern. The team-based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever, and the game's competitive depth is unmatched.

However, my enjoyment of CS2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating. I've encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches, and it's starting to ruin the experience for me. It's frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks, and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game's competitive nature.

I know that Valve is working on improving VAC, but it doesn't seem to be enough at the moment. Cheating is a serious problem in CS2, and it's something that Valve needs to address as soon as possible.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first-person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren't for the prevalence of cheating."
730;Counter-Strike 2;20 years industry leading PC FPS still has an embarrassing anti cheat
730;Counter-Strike 2;Spoko gierka
730;Counter-Strike 2;A game where you can meet people with different ethnic backgrounds. I jump with ecstasy whenever I interact with this friendly and welcoming community.  A non-toxic diverse community where race, gender and religion has not restrictions. 11/10.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Your team in every random competitive game:

- You
- Russian Guy
- Another Russian Guy
- A 6 year old kid who slept with your mother
- Russian Guy who speaks English"
730;Counter-Strike 2;Awful game. CS:GO was obviously better
730;Counter-Strike 2;"I'm sorry, Valve, but your idea of a CS game s**u**c**k**s a**s**s with a straw.
CS:GO was just fine the way it was.
The only thing it needed was a better anti-cheat system, just like TF2 does... instead you made the game crap. You made me have more fun playing CS 1.6 and that's really saying something.
Tell me, what was wrong with [TEAM] DEATHMATCH? Why does friendly-fire have to be enabled by default in my ex-favorite game mode? I know, right? Why WOULD you concentrate on killing the enemy team? Nooo. Just kill each other. It's much more fun to not be able to even tell what's going on.
Or the gun-game. Or everything else. I had to fiddle around for 15 damn minutes trying to equip my StatTrak weapon - because that is the reason I paid money for it, to use it - until i found out it's a drag-and-drop system, and you can no longer select from a multitude of weapons.
You know what? I want my money back for CS:GO, since the game is no longer in my game library. I don't want this utter crap you replaced it with."
730;Counter-Strike 2;They deleted CSGO for this shIt
730;Counter-Strike 2;Only have russians who dont speak english, are toxic and on shit ping make them their own server.
730;Counter-Strike 2;This may come as a shock to some, but the anti-cheat does not work. Not only does it fail to ban real cheaters, today after loosing a string of games, with a negative and frankly embarrassing kd, I myself was VAC banned. I have never cheated in a video game, no scripts, not a single dodgy download, nada. I don't care that I cant play this shitty game, I care that my reputation is now tarnished because of a false ban. We shall see how customer support deals with this, but somehow I doubt I will get any justice.
730;Counter-Strike 2;My life would've probably improved significantly if I spent those 52.6 hours doing something else
730;Counter-Strike 2;lot of cheaters
730;Counter-Strike 2;give us back csgo. you cant serious expect me to enjoy this game after removing my favorite map (train) and 11 years worth of csgo history. we even found a way to go back to csgo and you removed it just because of a stupid fucking split in the player base?! you could have just made cs2 its own game and give it a better name with new maps, new skins, new gamemodes, you could even add more operations to advance the cs lore and make more money cause it seems like to me thats all your starting to care about valve. dont forget about the fps drops, e.g csgo could run on any computer at good fps but cs2 needs a modern day computer to be playable. better idea, instead of spending all that time making cs2 YOU SHOULD'VE GIVEN US A REAL FUCKING UPDATE FOR TF2, HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING VALVE. this whole scenario reminds me of titanfall 2 and apex (apex shoud have been titanfall 3) but i feel that was more ruined by ea. even if i havent played csgo since its release i still know that cs2 is shit. i did learn something from cs2 and that was that earth is the closest planet to the sun, i know that the whole brightness thing was for visibility but still WHY IS IT SO FUCKING BRIGHT, IT LOOKS SO BAD, i cant even fix it ive tried and it just doesnt work, no matter what i do its still bright, can you at least give us an option to make it look like csgo again? im gonna end my rant here because honestly i feel like no matter how much people complain you wont do shit valve, so ill see you all in hell and if you make half life 3 do it on source not source 2, source 2 sucks dick.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"A literal downgrade of CSGO. Gameplay changes, aesthetics etc. all worse than they were.

Other negatives:
-Ui placement and navigation is confusing and overcomplicated.
-By default the crosshair follows the spray pattern wich means your aim will go EVERYWHERE where you arent aiming, making proper shooting even harder unless you mess with a load of settings. This feature is literally confusing and unnecessary.
-The community is literal filth. Nonstop toxic ppl insulting, griefing, teamkilling, shouting and in a single match i heard the n word more than i did in my entire life. (now imagine all of this in every match)
-The anti cheat is technically non existant. 8/10 matches have at least 1 blatant cheater. And thats with the premium ""safe"" matchmaking.
-The amount of russian players has only increased wich HEAVILY increased toxicity.
-Somehow the gunplay feels even more unpredictable and unstable making fights feel as if you have to be lucky to get anything done.

Overall do yourselves a favor and play literally anything else coz this game is literally a waste of time at this point."
730;Counter-Strike 2;"No more map faction playermodels but you can look at your legs :ooooo

Fuck off Valve"
730;Counter-Strike 2;"You will get banned for griefing a lot.
This game isn't good for your sanity.

The biggest problem is still the same as in CS:GO, cheaters have easy access to new accounts so the margin never changes. I'm actually thinking about dropping PvP games completely, humankind is cancer."
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Dear Valve,

Please give us CS:GO back. We didn't pay for this pile of hot shit. I bought CS:GO before it was free to play and you have just deleted my game. I don't give a rats ass what your terms of service say, I payed for a good game and you took it away from me. You didn't even have the decency to replace it with something that works or is a finished product.

Also valve, grow a pair. release CS2 as a standalone game alongside CS:GO and let the player numbers speak for themselves. Valve would never do this because then everyone would see that people are playing CS:GO over this trash.

GTFO,
The People who Gave you Money XOXOXO!!!"

730;Counter-Strike 2;"Counter-Strike 2 - Even though it's a glorified upgrade. You can't really do much to make the CS formula better. The main modification is the increased dynamic fog that is impacted by nades and gunshots. Otherwise, images now appear literally ""polished""... a tad bit brighter, clearer, less grainy, and warmer. Additionally, the user interface has been improved.

Gameplay wise it is the identical antique, bullet spread appears more random even as shifting however otherwise can not notice something else. however in any other case this update is simply refinement.. do not anticipate some thing to blow you out of the water.

252490;Rust;"Rust: the most difficult shooter. You need a high tolerance for digital pain. It's hard enough to progress from naked on the beach to bows, hard to get from bows to guns, and hard to stay alive long enough to keep them. Servers have zero matchmaking, and so you will get killed by sneaky shotgun grubs, head-clicking chads, and huge zerg groups, usually after you've acquired a full inventory of loot. Other players will be toxic trash talkers, backstabbing liars, and ruthless raiders. The most mundane activities like chopping wood, filling a water jug, or even walking out your front door can be fatal. Any time you log on, raiders could have blown holes in your base and taken all your stuff while you slept IRL -- or they might confidently fight their way in while you're online and defending! Every play has a counter play, but you are always rolling the dice. I think of Rust like a slower Battle Royale - it's not over one session; it's over several days, where you build a base (or two or three), then accumulate (and lose) gear as you upgrade your humble hut into a fortress.

It's hard to think of a shooter with higher stakes. You miss one arrow or one bullet and you lose your base to raiders. You make one bad decision and your team wipes, instead of coming home with the other team's loot. You stay out too long and you get swarmed by opportunists who heard the chance to get rich in the sound of distant gunshots. You shoot the wrong people from your roof, and you make enemies who raid you. You run back to your base at the wrong time, and your enemies learn where you live and raid you. You pick the wrong base to raid and you get nothing in return, instead of a huge payout. You raid recklessly and you blow yourself up -- or somebody comes along and steals your hard won loot and explosives from you. You make one mistake in building your base and raiders exploit it. The learning curve is a cliff. Your naivety, perfectionism, inattention to detail, passivity, and recklessness will get better, one painful loss at a time.

The challenge makes victory so much sweeter. Sometimes, you stumble across a giant brawl with one gamer standing, kill him while he's teabagging, and take ALL the loot home. Sometimes, your raids make you rich -- your raid, or the one you steal from another team. Sometimes, you lose over and over, but progress in drips and drabs anyway. Sometimes, it's the small victories, like stealing a clan's boat -- or helicopter. Sometimes your mind games work and gamers think you're too poor to be worth raiding or blame somebody else for the trouble you caused them. Sometimes, your diplomacy works and you find allies to help defend you from raids -- or to raid the baddest group, together. It's a magical feeling, when you close the front door to your base and know you've made it home safe, with the spoils of your latest adventure. Rust rewards your game knowledge, awareness, strategy, decision-making, teamwork, and patience like no shooter I've ever played.

Rust is a game of authentic, emergent gameplay. The PvE is laughably thin; PvP *is* the content. The maps are huge and procedural, where most structures are made by other gamers, not level designers. Even the static points of interest feel different when the surrounding terrain and player bases change from wipe to wipe. Where you build a base and the personalities of your neighbors makes each wipe a unique experience. A hostile fortress in the wrong spot can ruin your plans - whether by walling off the sulfur quarry you were hoping to mine or mercilessly sniping you as you pass - forcing you to adapt. Do use your mic! Though it opens you to toxicity, it also gives you the chance to make allies, mess with people's heads, and even talk your way out of bad situations. Rust generates so many good gaming stories that I have a journal full of them, and people edit their clips into movies -- with characters, plot, and stakes! -- on YouTube.

In the end, Rust is a sandbox. Your experience is in your hands. You chose your server -- sweaty, casual, roleplay, modded. You chose your goals, where you build your base, and what adventure to go on each time you leave. With perseverance, you will have satisfying wipes. You will eventually end a wipe rich in a fortress. Or you will finish building whatever fun, non-meta, roleplay thing you wanted - a trap base, a tower in the ocean, a farm, a car shop, a hotel, or even a haunted house. And you can accumulate several Discord servers worth of allies, willing to team up next wipe -- or right this moment, because you're getting raided! So get out there wearing your best gear, don't give up, and enjoy the journey.

252490;Rust;After 1700 hours, I still suck at this game.
252490;Rust;never played a lot, but watched hundreads videos
252490;Rust;R-U-S-T!
252490;Rust;The only fun thing about this game is the constant dick and balls, writing slurs on bases, and playing instruments. That's it, there's no other reason to play this dog shit.
252490;Rust;Naked women
252490;Rust;I spawn on the beach, excited for the wipe. So many fresh spawns running around, ready to get geared up. I hit my first tree and farm my first rock, until a bald black woman runs up to me shouting im a bald N**** woman and started spearing me in my genitalia. I spawn back on the beach only to get ear raped for someone who sounded 5 years old. Good game would play again.
252490;Rust;This game is so fun I love it when people call me slurs when I first installed this game I learned 3 new slurs within 10 seconds. 10/10 would recommend.
252490;Rust;Game stopped being fun after they made nighttime pitch black. Everyone is using the gamma trick to be able to see at night. Nobody can enforce the rules apparently, so anyone who's PC isn't compatible with the gamma trick is just unable to play a fair game. I can legit not get a base started in this game anymore because I die at night every single time to someone I can't even see. Totally unplayable, they need to either fix the gamma cheat or undue the update.

252490;Rust;"Brutal unforgiving PVP game. Has a great map, good sound, decent graphics (slightly dated). Expect no sympathy from other players, in fact expect hostility and tricks and unfair gameplay. People will raid your base when you're offline, or bully you when you're online. If you like super aggressive always anxious PVP then this is the game for you. Of course there's a way for you to stay a bit hidden from others, build a base and gear, and get them before they get you.

I once played on a server where I was getting shot at left and right. I finally found a place to set up a small base, which got raided, but they didn't kill me, just destroyed my walls and took my stuff. Some other dude showed up and said sorry and gave me more gear and told me to keep playing and get good and encouraged me to keep playing and enjoy the game. Really nice guy. I used the weapon he gave me to kill him and take his gear, which was all amazing stuff. I became overcome by fear and paranoia that he'd come back so I ran and ran and ran that day, but they never found me. Out of fear I just logged onto a different server lol.

Everyone in Rust has stories about the people they meet or the fights or double crosses they get into.

Game is ok solo but shines playing with friends, the more the better, which helps overcome the feeling of being overpowered or uneven matches/skill differences. Very unforgiving for new or solo players. Just gotta keep playing, practice, etc.

There are some servers with PVP turned off, so there are places to play in some peace and just do PVE, but that's not really how the game is designed. But just know there are other ways to play, if you want to.

Not a game for me due to my tastes, but I recognize that it's otherwise an amazing game with a big community and lots of people just love it."

252490;Rust;"Rust, a game I initially approached with curiosity and excitement, ended up being a double-edged sword that cut deep into my daily life. The addictive pull of the relentless survival mechanics and the constant threat of losing progress created a toxic cycle that left me resenting both the game and the hours I sunk into it. The thrill of triumph quickly gave way to frustration and despair as I found myself ensnared in a web of addiction. Rust became more than just a virtual world; it infiltrated my reality, making me neglect crucial aspects of my daily routine and leading to a profound dislike for the life it had begun to overshadow. In retrospect, my experience with Rust serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of diving too deep into the allure of virtual survival, a journey that left me questioning the true value of the time and emotions invested in a game that ultimately brought more frustration than fulfillment."
252490;Rust;"Rust is like a survival game, but instead of cuddly woodland creatures and a peaceful crafting experience, you get thrust into a world where your most valuable possession is a rock, and your best friend is a shrub.

I started my Rust adventure with high hopes of peacefully building a quaint little cabin in the woods. Little did I know, the woods were filled with more backstabbing than a medieval political drama. The first lesson I learned: never trust a naked person with a rock. They might seem harmless, but that rock is their ticket to the bone-crushing, post-apocalyptic circus that is Rust.

The graphics are like a chaotic masterpiece painted by a mad artist. The landscapes are beautiful, but the moment you appreciate the sunrise, someone sneaks up behind you with a spear. It's like Mother Nature and the local psychopath teamed up to create the ultimate obstacle course.

Communication in Rust is a delicate dance of gestures, grunts, and interpretive rock throwing. You'll spend more time forming alliances and breaking them than you will actually gathering resources. It's a social experiment gone horribly wrong, and I can't get enough of it.

The highlight of my Rust experience was when I stumbled upon a group of players dressed as clowns, armed with nothing but musical instruments. They proceeded to serenade me while stealing everything I owned. It was the most entertaining mugging I've ever experienced.

The crafting system is as complex as a Rubik's Cube, but instead of solving it, you're desperately trying not to be beaten to death by a guy wearing only a pumpkin on his head. It's a unique blend of frustration and amusement that keeps you coming back for more.

In conclusion, Rust is not just a game; it's a psychological rollercoaster where your sanity is the only casualty. If you enjoy beautiful landscapes, unpredictable player interactions, and the constant fear of losing your pants, Rust is the game for you. Just remember: in Rust, friendships are temporary, rocks are forever."
252490;Rust;I hate this game, I really do.  But I can’t stop thinking about it, or thinking about playing it.  It’s highly addictive and even after getting dumpstered for 6 hours straight all I need is one good run or raid and they drag me back in.

252490;Rust;Loading screens are so long it's not even funny.
252490;Rust;this game saved my virginity and made me racism and child abuser
252490;Rust;"An absolute blast, better with friends, but also very fun solo. 
It has a lot of aspects that appeal to different people. 
For me (someone how enjoys PvP at a low level) I find it exciting to build and create while under the threat of PvP shenanigans. 
There are a lot of good people that play, a lot of toxic people as with any game, but overall the majority of people are chill if you're chill. Many fun interactions and new friends made by giving a well deserved GG after getting wrecked in a fight. 
Building mechanics are my personal favorite, I love the electronic circuits which many people don't give enough time to use. They are not at all needed, but a nice quality of life feature if you learn them (or have a teammate that can set up things). Having lights, defenses, convenience things like auto door controllers, or goofy things are all viable and fun to me. 
Give this game a try, there will likely be something you enjoy. The developers actively keep the game updated, lots of DLC and skins are fun and to be honest, because the game is so well kept up, I don't mind the occasional skin or DLC to support development. 
Have fun!"

252490;Rust;"I will try my best to provide some suggestions for this game.
First of all, this is a truly unbeatable game that you must try. You can find all the features that are considered a ""good game"": high quality, controls, etc. The game is not easy to get started, so you need to spend a relatively long time working on the preliminary work, but when you complete some preparations, you can truly appreciate the joy of this game.
To run this game, you need some device support and sufficient running memory. This is my suggestion. When you start playing, you will know the importance of my words. This is what I'm not very satisfied with about this game.
Finally, GOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN! 😉"
252490;Rust;Very Good Game
252490;Rust;"Rust is a game that is pretty honest up front -- punishingly difficult survival craft. As difficult as it may be, it's not the sort of survival craft where the game slowly defeats you. Yes, there is hunger & thirst & all that jazz, but that's not the push to survive; indeed, if there is anything or anyone on your side, it is the game itself. The game will present you with the resources you need; you can make chance discoveries that will advantage you quite a bit. The real threat is the other players with the same goal as you -- survive above all else. When you're not paying attention, in your inventory maybe & you take damage only to turn around & see a naked person bashing your skull in with a rock, you can rest assured that it wasn't the game that defeated you, it was your lesser will to survive. This is something that is lost in many of the survival craft open-world games that have been so well received over the last several years -- & the range is vast; from Ark: Survival Evolved all the way over to even Valheim! That's right; I said it! Valheim!

Why does Rust seem to draw criticism?
- Joining a server requires loading a lot of assets -- thus, the game requires a pretty fast internet connection, a pretty fast ssd (3rd or 4th Gen M.2 NVMe speeds), & a pretty decent amount of system RAM (~16Gb at least)
- Rust was released in 2018, but has underwent a complete graphics overhaul recently -- making the mistake that the game will play on Ultra settings without a serious GPU might be common... Those complaining of 45m waits to load into a server only for it to crash are likely making a mistake of this sort
- Rust is a game that will naturally draw out rage from the more youthful gaming crowd, thereby leaving the game susceptible to toxic environments...(?)
- There is no native gamepad support; Mouse & Keyboard controls only....

Overall though, I would generally recommend Rust. There are plenty of active servers; the game looks & plays great; & it's a well paced gaming experience."
252490;Rust;game ruined my life
252490;Rust;the best game to destroy the nervous system
252490;Rust;"Although I don't have much time to play this game, but I have to say: It is a very GOOD game! But I suggest you check whether your computer's RAM is greater than 10GB before you buy this game (preferably more than 16GB) because my computer's RAM is only 8GB and I need to wait long time to join the server.
Have a good time in RUST!"

252490;Rust;This is such a fun game!, i genuinely would recommend at least trying to play. There is no manual or tutorial its just figure out as you go and you end up playing for hours on end because you just keep learning new things as you go. It is definitely addicting but its so much fun and a very grinding type of game. It can definitely be frustrating when you die but its also motivating to try harder and get better at the game. I LOVE RUST :P

252490;Rust;"""Rust"" is a hardcore survival journey that drops you into a challenging open-world, and hats off to Facepunch Studios for creating an experience that's both brutal and exhilarating.

Visually, the game nails the essence of survival. The landscapes, from dense forests to vast deserts, set the stage for the struggle to survive. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather immerse you in the harsh reality of the world.

What sets ""Rust"" apart is the intense player-versus-player action. The constant threat of encounters with other players, whether they become allies or adversaries, keeps the adrenaline pumping. Gathering resources, building shelter, and facing off against not just wildlife but also fellow survivors make every moment a tense and thrilling experience.

Base building is a big deal in ""Rust."" Planning and managing resources for your fortress require thoughtful consideration. The freedom to get creative with structures, coupled with the risk of raids from other players, adds a layer of strategic depth to the game.

I appreciate the unique progression system with blueprints. Discovering or researching blueprints to craft advanced items adds an exciting element of exploration and interaction with other players to gain valuable knowledge.

The multiplayer dynamics are a double-edged sword. Forming alliances, engaging in trade, or getting caught up in player conflicts creates dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. The stories that unfold in this player-driven environment contribute to the game's enduring charm.

Now, let's talk about the learning curve – it's no walk in the park. Newcomers might feel the sting of the game's difficulty, especially in a world where experienced players rule. But hey, that challenge is part of what makes the victories so satisfying.

In summary, ""Rust"" is a survival masterpiece with its hardcore challenges and dynamic player-driven world. The visuals, the tense player interactions, and the strategic depth in base building make it stand out. While the learning curve can be steep, the triumphs in mastering the game's mechanics and thriving in its harsh landscape make it an intense and rewarding survival adventure."

252490;Rust;Got banned from a community server after a talk with the admin about another player broke server rules. I was told by the admin nothing was going to be done about it. Told the admin I would not be returning called him an ass once and left. few days later I tried joining another community server and was banned from that one. saw I had a ban checked the other server and found I was banned from that one for being toxic and disrespectful to server staff. If calling someone who is acting like a child an ass once is grounds for toxic behavior then don't play and mind you this all took place over discord I never broke any server rules but because a server admin decided to be petty I can't play on a lot of other servers. I do have screen shots of the messages between me and the admin but I don't know how to post them here.
252490;Rust;GAY
252490;Rust;You give up your sanity, life, well being for.. couple hours of good wipe. Totally worth it!
252490;Rust;This game is actually great, a grubs, griefers and survivals paradise. The content is so great, I even bought it on a discount for only 25€!. I started learning by myself, even tho in the start I found it so frustrating, but now, I enjoy it as much as I can. I just recommend to not play it everyday because its really time consuming. Great game 10/10.
252490;Rust;Very fun, you die a lot tho.
252490;Rust;LOVE THIS GAME
252490;Rust;This game is absolute dogshit

252490;Rust;this is a very good game.
252490;Rust;I don't have a bad pc but still takes an hour just to load all the game files to join a server. Better games to waste your money on than this toxic game, unless you like people avoiding pvp unless you are unarmed and wait till you log out to raid your base.

252490;Rust;Game sucks
252490;Rust;"game is the goat
"
252490;Rust;"This game is trash. Disgusting load times (20 min +).  And more bugs than a nasty run down hotel.  
You'll get ejected from the game randomly, then need to wait 20 min to get back in. 

Good news their adding more content, instead of fixing the bugs."

252490;Rust;Good Game for a couple hours
252490;Rust;Amazing if your into spawning naked on a beach while being roofcamped by people with snipers from the tops of their bases and being yelled at with racial slurs of any kind.

252490;Rust;"In the world of survival games, Rust stands out as the ultimate choice for adventure seekers. This game provides a unique and immersive experience that enhances problem-solving skills by putting players in challenging situations where they must think on their feet to survive. Moreover, Rust fosters teamwork and collaboration, as players have to form alliances and work together to overcome the game's obstacles. The game also promotes creativity and resourcefulness, as players must utilize the limited resources available to them to build shelters, weapons, and tools. But the benefits of playing Rust extend beyond mere entertainment. Surprisingly, this game has taught players unexpected life-saving lessons that can be applied in real-life situations, making it a truly valuable experience for anyone seeking both fun and practical skills.

In the game Rust, players not only engage in thrilling survival gameplay, but they also inadvertently gain unexpected life-saving lessons. These valuable lessons can have a significant impact on real-life situations. One important skill that Rust fosters is the ability to assess risks and make quick decisions under pressure. This can be particularly useful in emergency situations where split-second choices can mean the difference between life and death. Additionally, Rust teaches players the importance of resource management and prioritization. These skills translate to real-life scenarios, such as disaster preparedness or critical thinking during unexpected events. Playing Rust also encourages players to think creatively and find innovative solutions to problems, which can further enhance their problem-solving skills in real-life situations. Ultimately, by playing Rust, individuals can acquire practical skills and knowledge that could potentially save lives in unforeseen circumstances.

In the wild world of Rust, laughter becomes the armor that protects us from the harsh realities of survival. With every unpredictable encounter and daring escape, humor becomes an essential ingredient in the game experience. It adds a delightful twist, allowing players to find joy and absurdity in even the most challenging situations. From unexpected encounters with fellow players to hilarious mishaps during resource gathering, there is never a shortage of opportunities for laughter. The game's mechanics and interactions often lead to absurd and comical moments that bring players closer together, forming bonds through shared laughter. In the face of danger and adversity, laughter becomes the glue that holds our virtual friendships together, reminding us that even in the toughest of times, joy can be found. Adding humor to the Rust experience ensures that while we may be fighting to survive, we never lose our sense of fun and playfulness. So, embrace the hilarity, embrace the unexpected, and let laughter be your best armor in the world of Rust. It brings us together, saves us from the doldrums, and adds that extra spark of enjoyment that keeps us coming back for more."
252490;Rust;It's an amazing game don't get me wrong but new recoil killed all skill based gameplay it was a horrible idea

252490;Rust;"Rust is celebrating 10 years and yet prices are not localized, people outside north america and europe need to expend more than the game's price just to buy a rock on discount, it's stupid. Maybe they just don't care, considering there are not even south american servers oficially. But even if this is true, as a company trying to make money they should be smart and make this in a way people would actually buy their shit. I'm sure they make some profit, only because players love the game and will go to great lenghts just to get some skins, but a affordable store means a lot more sales. It's like they don't understand basic economy and this is nuts.
Great game, shitty support, buy at your own risk."
252490;Rust;I request refund - way to toxic environment, no fun at all.
252490;Rust;"Rust is not just a game; it's an experience that taps into the primal instincts of survival, camaraderie, and triumph. Facepunch Studios has crafted a masterpiece that demands to be explored, conquered, and celebrated. Whether you're a seasoned survival enthusiast or a newcomer to the genre, Rust will take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, leaving an indelible mark on your gaming soul. Passionate, immersive, and downright exhilarating, Rust stands as a testament to the boundless potential of the gaming medium."

252490;Rust;Very fun game with intuitive game mechanics that makes it easy for new players to quickly learn to enjoy the game. The community is also extremely friendly and welcoming. I've personally had a really wholesome experience throughout. I highly recommend this game especially for new players.
252490;Rust;"Exploring the wilderness near my base. See another player. Wave. He shoots me in the face and kills me. Respawn. Continue exploring the wilderness, see the same player, again he shoots me in the face and kills me. Respawn. Back to the wilderness, this time very careful. Find the same player, follow him, find out where he lives. For the next week save up sulfur, electronics and cloth. Build 20 timed charges. Go back to his base, blow off every door, find him sleeping, murder him in revenge, take over his base. Build a trophy with his skull and hang it at his front door.

252490;Rust;"you need a team to have more fun

252490;Rust;How is this game this old and still have people that can ESP and hack the game. They DEV's must be involved with it as they are making a shit ton from people buying the scripts. People can buy an account for 5$ and ruin your whole wipe and experience in the game. 0/5 stars. People see though walls, see what you have in your inventory, have aim bot that targets you automatically with zero recoil. I have played this game for 3,000 hours and it has been a thing since day one.  Not to mention the amount of 12 year old's that are screaming the N word 24/7. This game should have an age limit to it as kids obviously are learning bad behaviors for this game. DO NOT DOWNLOAD

252490;Rust;Best Family Friendly Game out there right now!
252490;Rust;"Best Game Ever! Everyone is always so polite. No matter what server you join, you can just run up to any random person or knock on their door at their base and ask for help. Everyone is always so willing to help. I've never played a game with such a mature, relaxed, easy-going helpful community behind it like Rust. 

I've finally found a game without the trolls and a mature audience to relax and spend time with. You can really have deep conversations with just about anyone! 

A+++ Highly Recommend!"
252490;Rust;Its rust
252490;Rust;Beware: Addictive.
252490;Rust;"Want to have fun without having to spend 24 hours playing every day? Developer says no because it's not how you're supposed to play
Want to play on Steam Deck/Linux? Developer says no because of EAC support disabled because Linux compatibility is ""enabling cheating"" (can't even play with anticheat disabled)
Want to craft a virtual megaphone? Developer says pay up 12 dollars to be able to
Want to use family share? Developer says disabled because we want more money

If you want to willingly torture yourself with this type of game then get something that isn't made by a developer so incompetent and greedy hiding behind ""we're the developers of gmod"" and ""we're indie"""

252490;Rust;Playing this game is like smoking crack. It feels good but you slowly die on the inside. If there is one thing Rust has taught me it would be the dictionary of slurs. This game takes the most toxic people, throws them in one server and lets them battle it out for a set amount of time until it wipes and restarts the cycle. 10/10 would recommend

252490;Rust;i accidentally made a kid cry because i eco raided him. he then proceeded to call me the nword shortly after. great game.
252490;Rust;Do you love being called the N word? What about farming tons of supplies and losing it? Maybe even opening a door and getting  camped by a naked bald freshy? If these things sound fun to you then rust is your game! Bush campers and roof campers in every grid. Virgins around the map never getting off the game. Getting shot in the back every gun fight. Man rust is amazing, such a blast. Foreigners hacking and taking your loot or big teams grieving your base. If you like to break things like maybe a monitor or desk rust is for you.
252490;Rust;my girlfriend dumped me because i played too much
252490;Rust;My girlfriend who i play this game with said if I post a review on this and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that she will give me a bj so im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha
252490;Rust;I live with constant fear :)
252490;Rust;Buy this game if you're looking to ruin your life.
252490;Rust;My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on rust: The Game and it gets 75 likes and 20 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
252490;Rust;This is not a game, this is an alternative existence. You will love it and hate it, you will dream about it, you will think of everything in terms of Scrap and Sulphur.
252490;Rust;This game consumed my life , I’ve left my wife ,abandoned the kids, dropped out of school , quit work , quit showers and daily activities to sit at my pc in my mothers basement all day to play rust 22 hours a day. Needless to say I smell like dick cheese but I have rust so it makes it ok. Rust is love rust is life. I highly recommend this game.
252490;Rust;I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game immediately after release. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
252490;Rust;"Rust has a reputation for being toxic, but in my opinion that's because all new players go straight to the high-pop official servers and immediately get rekt by the rude kids who play there. If you try some of the thousands of community/modded servers you will soon find a very pleasant gaming experience if that's what you prefer.

Another thing to note is that Rust retains it popularity year after year because it's constantly evolving and improving. There is a feature update every single month, it keeps players coming back for more."

252490;Rust;"This game has ruined my life. I have never felt more isolated from my friends and family and feel more depressed than ever before. I have slept with my headset on every night for the past 3 years causing the bone structure in my skull to be permanently damaged. I get 3 and a half hours of sleep every night which resulted in a rare disorder where my height is stunted and i am unable to digest food. I weigh about 240 pounds and im 4'3"". I hear echoes from the depths of hell, grabbing at my ankles to drag me down to the demons that i have upset in my past life. My walls scream at me as I beam retards from the top of oil rig. I hear footsteps when i sleep and the explosions of rockets haunt my nightmares. every therapist and doctor ive seen has tried to lock me into a psych ward, but you are not allowed to bring in electronics, so there is no way to see if I am being raided and I will miss at least three force wipes (months for normies) which is completely unacceptable. I fear now more than ever that my sins will catch up to me, and I will live a life down bad and #PrimLocked in the darkest pit of the universe with nothing but the rust theme song repeating in my ears over and over and over and over again. 5/10 its worth it if you get it at sale. thank you for all the points<3 this game is still fucking horrible"

252490;Rust;No one reads the reviews anyway, so I will write that I am gay
252490;Rust;If your vision of paradise is being called the n word by 10 year olds as they destroy a weeks worth of grinding, this game is perfect for you.
252490;Rust;"Lets start off with the fact that this game is like a full time job and herion addiction all in one. no other game in the world demand 12+ hours a day to make any progess, not to include the fact that you lose everything after sometime between a week and a month. I was written up twice at work sue to being late defending online raids, to which i was put in a stick situation and thought the correct answer to skate by was ""my fault, K12 wouldnt fuck off, maybe be a bit more understanding next time. Just to come home from work, and get smoked by 12+ man clans causing me to want to take a newborn puppy and repeatedly slam it into the sidewalk listening to it whimper and it pleasing my cruel thoughts that are heavily induced by this monstrosity of a game. There needs to be studies behind the reason a game such as rust is so addicting, yet so suicide inticing, rate it 3 sweaty no life fat fucks out of 10."
252490;Rust;i have had many things done to me that noone should experience. and have been called the N word counterless times

252490;Rust;Rust is a wild ride where you start naked, dodge falling trees, and negotiate with neighbours who think they're Vikings. Building is a sitcom, meeting strangers is a comedy sketch, and your dignity is optional. If you're up for chaos, laughs, and questioning your life choices, Rust is the hilarious roller coaster you need. Just remember your virtual sunscreen – it's a wild world out there!

252490;Rust;"Rust: the most difficult shooter. You need a high tolerance for digital pain. It's hard enough to progress from naked on the beach to bows, hard to get from bows to guns, and hard to stay alive long enough to keep them. Servers have zero matchmaking, and so you will get killed by sneaky shotgun grubs, head-clicking chads, and huge zerg groups, usually after you've acquired a full inventory of loot. Other players will be toxic trash talkers, backstabbing liars, and ruthless raiders. The most mundane activities like chopping wood, filling a water jug, or even walking out your front door can be fatal. Any time you log on, raiders could have blown holes in your base and taken all your stuff while you slept IRL -- or they might confidently fight their way in while you're online and defending! Every play has a counter play, but you are always rolling the dice. I think of Rust like a slower Battle Royale - it's not over one session; it's over several days, where you build a base (or two or three), then accumulate (and lose) gear as you upgrade your humble hut into a fortress.

It's hard to think of a shooter with higher stakes. You miss one arrow or one bullet and you lose your base to raiders. You make one bad decision and your team wipes, instead of coming home with the other team's loot. You stay out too long and you get swarmed by opportunists who heard the chance to get rich in the sound of distant gunshots. You shoot the wrong people from your roof, and you make enemies who raid you. You run back to your base at the wrong time, and your enemies learn where you live and raid you. You pick the wrong base to raid and you get nothing in return, instead of a huge payout. You raid recklessly and you blow yourself up -- or somebody comes along and steals your hard won loot and explosives from you. You make one mistake in building your base and raiders exploit it. The learning curve is a cliff. Your naivety, perfectionism, inattention to detail, passivity, and recklessness will get better, one painful loss at a time.

The challenge makes victory so much sweeter. Sometimes, you stumble across a giant brawl with one gamer standing, kill him while he's teabagging, and take ALL the loot home. Sometimes, your raids make you rich -- your raid, or the one you steal from another team. Sometimes, you lose over and over, but progress in drips and drabs anyway. Sometimes, it's the small victories, like stealing a clan's boat -- or helicopter. Sometimes your mind games work and gamers think you're too poor to be worth raiding or blame somebody else for the trouble you caused them. Sometimes, your diplomacy works and you find allies to help defend you from raids -- or to raid the baddest group, together. It's a magical feeling, when you close the front door to your base and know you've made it home safe, with the spoils of your latest adventure. Rust rewards your game knowledge, awareness, strategy, decision-making, teamwork, and patience like no shooter I've ever played.

Rust is a game of authentic, emergent gameplay. The PvE is laughably thin; PvP *is* the content. The maps are huge and procedural, where most structures are made by other gamers, not level designers. Even the static points of interest feel different when the surrounding terrain and player bases change from wipe to wipe. Where you build a base and the personalities of your neighbors makes each wipe a unique experience. A hostile fortress in the wrong spot can ruin your plans - whether by walling off the sulfur quarry you were hoping to mine or mercilessly sniping you as you pass - forcing you to adapt. Do use your mic! Though it opens you to toxicity, it also gives you the chance to make allies, mess with people's heads, and even talk your way out of bad situations. Rust generates so many good gaming stories that I have a journal full of them, and people edit their clips into movies -- with characters, plot, and stakes! -- on YouTube.

In the end, Rust is a sandbox. Your experience is in your hands. You chose your server -- sweaty, casual, roleplay, modded. You chose your goals, where you build your base, and what adventure to go on each time you leave. With perseverance, you will have satisfying wipes. You will eventually end a wipe rich in a fortress. Or you will finish building whatever fun, non-meta, roleplay thing you wanted - a trap base, a tower in the ocean, a farm, a car shop, a hotel, or even a haunted house. And you can accumulate several Discord servers worth of allies, willing to team up next wipe -- or right this moment, because you're getting raided! So get out there wearing your best gear, don't give up, and enjoy the journey.

252490;Rust;never played a lot, but watched hundreads videos
252490;Rust;R-U-S-T!
252490;Rust;The only fun thing about this game is the constant dick and balls, writing slurs on bases, and playing instruments. That's it, there's no other reason to play this dog shit.
252490;Rust;Naked women
252490;Rust;I spawn on the beach, excited for the wipe. So many fresh spawns running around, ready to get geared up. I hit my first tree and farm my first rock, until a bald black woman runs up to me shouting im a bald N**** woman and started spearing me in my genitalia. I spawn back on the beach only to get ear raped for someone who sounded 5 years old. Good game would play again.
252490;Rust;This game is so fun I love it when people call me slurs when I first installed this game I learned 3 new slurs within 10 seconds. 10/10 would recommend.
252490;Rust;Game stopped being fun after they made nighttime pitch black. Everyone is using the gamma trick to be able to see at night. Nobody can enforce the rules apparently, so anyone who's PC isn't compatible with the gamma trick is just unable to play a fair game. I can legit not get a base started in this game anymore because I die at night every single time to someone I can't even see. Totally unplayable, they need to either fix the gamma cheat or undue the update.

252490;Rust;cool :)
252490;Rust;"Brutal unforgiving PVP game. Has a great map, good sound, decent graphics (slightly dated). Expect no sympathy from other players, in fact expect hostility and tricks and unfair gameplay. People will raid your base when you're offline, or bully you when you're online. If you like super aggressive always anxious PVP then this is the game for you. Of course there's a way for you to stay a bit hidden from others, build a base and gear, and get them before they get you.

I once played on a server where I was getting shot at left and right. I finally found a place to set up a small base, which got raided, but they didn't kill me, just destroyed my walls and took my stuff. Some other dude showed up and said sorry and gave me more gear and told me to keep playing and get good and encouraged me to keep playing and enjoy the game. Really nice guy. I used the weapon he gave me to kill him and take his gear, which was all amazing stuff. I became overcome by fear and paranoia that he'd come back so I ran and ran and ran that day, but they never found me. Out of fear I just logged onto a different server lol.

Everyone in Rust has stories about the people they meet or the fights or double crosses they get into.

Game is ok solo but shines playing with friends, the more the better, which helps overcome the feeling of being overpowered or uneven matches/skill differences. Very unforgiving for new or solo players. Just gotta keep playing, practice, etc.

There are some servers with PVP turned off, so there are places to play in some peace and just do PVE, but that's not really how the game is designed. But just know there are other ways to play, if you want to.

Not a game for me due to my tastes, but I recognize that it's otherwise an amazing game with a big community and lots of people just love it."

Random 3 AM loot inspections.
Paranoia of sounds that rival even the most seasoned meth head.
Man made architecture that could only be conjured by a schizophrenic.
A time machine that will consume your entire weekend.
You will feel like the victim of gang stalking at all times.
The clicking of stone on metal haunts your dreams.
Stare blankly into your furnace at night while eating a bowl of top ramen.
The situations you find your self in will become folk lore of your friend group.
The bad times will be recounted fondly with your friends.
The good times will be embellished to mythical levels.
God speed and may your wipe days be fruitful.

252490;Rust;i accidentally made a kid cry because i eco raided him. he then proceeded to call me the nword shortly after. great game.
252490;Rust;Do you love being called the N word? What about farming tons of supplies and losing it? Maybe even opening a door and getting  camped by a naked bald freshy? If these things sound fun to you then rust is your game! Bush campers and roof campers in every grid. Virgins around the map never getting off the game. Getting shot in the back every gun fight. Man rust is amazing, such a blast. Foreigners hacking and taking your loot or big teams grieving your base. If you like to break things like maybe a monitor or desk rust is for you.
252490;Rust;my girlfriend dumped me because i played too much
252490;Rust;My girlfriend who i play this game with said if I post a review on this and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that she will give me a bj so im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha
252490;Rust;I live with constant fear :)
252490;Rust;Buy this game if you're looking to ruin your life.
252490;Rust;My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on rust: The Game and it gets 75 likes and 20 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
252490;Rust;This is not a game, this is an alternative existence. You will love it and hate it, you will dream about it, you will think of everything in terms of Scrap and Sulphur.
252490;Rust;This game consumed my life , I’ve left my wife ,abandoned the kids, dropped out of school , quit work , quit showers and daily activities to sit at my pc in my mothers basement all day to play rust 22 hours a day. Needless to say I smell like dick cheese but I have rust so it makes it ok. Rust is love rust is life. I highly recommend this game.
252490;Rust;I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game immediately after release. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
252490;Rust;"Rust has a reputation for being toxic, but in my opinion that's because all new players go straight to the high-pop official servers and immediately get rekt by the rude kids who play there. If you try some of the thousands of community/modded servers you will soon find a very pleasant gaming experience if that's what you prefer.

Another thing to note is that Rust retains it popularity year after year because it's constantly evolving and improving. There is a feature update every single month, it keeps players coming back for more."

252490;Rust;"This game has ruined my life. I have never felt more isolated from my friends and family and feel more depressed than ever before. I have slept with my headset on every night for the past 3 years causing the bone structure in my skull to be permanently damaged. I get 3 and a half hours of sleep every night which resulted in a rare disorder where my height is stunted and i am unable to digest food. I weigh about 240 pounds and im 4'3"". I hear echoes from the depths of hell, grabbing at my ankles to drag me down to the demons that i have upset in my past life. My walls scream at me as I beam retards from the top of oil rig. I hear footsteps when i sleep and the explosions of rockets haunt my nightmares. every therapist and doctor ive seen has tried to lock me into a psych ward, but you are not allowed to bring in electronics, so there is no way to see if I am being raided and I will miss at least three force wipes (months for normies) which is completely unacceptable. I fear now more than ever that my sins will catch up to me, and I will live a life down bad and #PrimLocked in the darkest pit of the universe with nothing but the rust theme song repeating in my ears over and over and over and over again. 5/10 its worth it if you get it at sale. thank you for all the points<3 this game is still fucking horrible"
252490;Rust;10/10 if hate chocolate people i was black got call n word i built a wood base then got rocket raided and call n word they let me live and put me in a cell i dident know you could comit suisde but they would walk by and call me the n word then made me fight of black people wih my rock and told me to eat the dead peoples meat Recomend if your character is not black
252490;Rust;No one reads the reviews anyway, so I will write that I am gay
252490;Rust;If your vision of paradise is being called the n word by 10 year olds as they destroy a weeks worth of grinding, this game is perfect for you.
252490;Rust;"Lets start off with the fact that this game is like a full time job and herion addiction all in one. no other game in the world demand 12+ hours a day to make any progess, not to include the fact that you lose everything after sometime between a week and a month. I was written up twice at work sue to being late defending online raids, to which i was put in a stick situation and thought the correct answer to skate by was ""my fault, K12 wouldnt fuck off, maybe be a bit more understanding next time. Just to come home from work, and get smoked by 12+ man clans causing me to want to take a newborn puppy and repeatedly slam it into the sidewalk listening to it whimper and it pleasing my cruel thoughts that are heavily induced by this monstrosity of a game. There needs to be studies behind the reason a game such as rust is so addicting, yet so suicide inticing, rate it 3 sweaty no life fat fucks out of 10."
252490;Rust;i have had many things done to me that noone should experience. and have been called the N word counterless times
252490;Rust;Can Eat Human Meat But Can't Drink Gasoline.
252490;Rust;Escape while you can!!! Don't get trapped in this hell hole. before you know it, youre kids, wife, family will have left you. Once you start, there is no going back. You will stay a virgin for life, become fat as hell and maybe even retarded!!!
252490;Rust;This is game is amazing but... for me an upgrade in the graphics and shooting physics like CS would be the best game ever!!!
252490;Rust;How I feel when I play this game, in order: :steamhappy: :steambored: :steammocking: :steamfacepalm: :steamsalty: :steamsad:

252490;Rust;Rust is a wild ride where you start naked, dodge falling trees, and negotiate with neighbours who think they're Vikings. Building is a sitcom, meeting strangers is a comedy sketch, and your dignity is optional. If you're up for chaos, laughs, and questioning your life choices, Rust is the hilarious roller coaster you need. Just remember your virtual sunscreen – it's a wild world out there!

252490;Rust;"Rust: the most difficult shooter. You need a high tolerance for digital pain. It's hard enough to progress from naked on the beach to bows, hard to get from bows to guns, and hard to stay alive long enough to keep them. Servers have zero matchmaking, and so you will get killed by sneaky shotgun grubs, head-clicking chads, and huge zerg groups, usually after you've acquired a full inventory of loot. Other players will be toxic trash talkers, backstabbing liars, and ruthless raiders. The most mundane activities like chopping wood, filling a water jug, or even walking out your front door can be fatal. Any time you log on, raiders could have blown holes in your base and taken all your stuff while you slept IRL -- or they might confidently fight their way in while you're online and defending! Every play has a counter play, but you are always rolling the dice. I think of Rust like a slower Battle Royale - it's not over one session; it's over several days, where you build a base (or two or three), then accumulate (and lose) gear as you upgrade your humble hut into a fortress.

It's hard to think of a shooter with higher stakes. You miss one arrow or one bullet and you lose your base to raiders. You make one bad decision and your team wipes, instead of coming home with the other team's loot. You stay out too long and you get swarmed by opportunists who heard the chance to get rich in the sound of distant gunshots. You shoot the wrong people from your roof, and you make enemies who raid you. You run back to your base at the wrong time, and your enemies learn where you live and raid you. You pick the wrong base to raid and you get nothing in return, instead of a huge payout. You raid recklessly and you blow yourself up -- or somebody comes along and steals your hard won loot and explosives from you. You make one mistake in building your base and raiders exploit it. The learning curve is a cliff. Your naivety, perfectionism, inattention to detail, passivity, and recklessness will get better, one painful loss at a time.

The challenge makes victory so much sweeter. Sometimes, you stumble across a giant brawl with one gamer standing, kill him while he's teabagging, and take ALL the loot home. Sometimes, your raids make you rich -- your raid, or the one you steal from another team. Sometimes, you lose over and over, but progress in drips and drabs anyway. Sometimes, it's the small victories, like stealing a clan's boat -- or helicopter. Sometimes your mind games work and gamers think you're too poor to be worth raiding or blame somebody else for the trouble you caused them. Sometimes, your diplomacy works and you find allies to help defend you from raids -- or to raid the baddest group, together. It's a magical feeling, when you close the front door to your base and know you've made it home safe, with the spoils of your latest adventure. Rust rewards your game knowledge, awareness, strategy, decision-making, teamwork, and patience like no shooter I've ever played.

Rust is a game of authentic, emergent gameplay. The PvE is laughably thin; PvP *is* the content. The maps are huge and procedural, where most structures are made by other gamers, not level designers. Even the static points of interest feel different when the surrounding terrain and player bases change from wipe to wipe. Where you build a base and the personalities of your neighbors makes each wipe a unique experience. A hostile fortress in the wrong spot can ruin your plans - whether by walling off the sulfur quarry you were hoping to mine or mercilessly sniping you as you pass - forcing you to adapt. Do use your mic! Though it opens you to toxicity, it also gives you the chance to make allies, mess with people's heads, and even talk your way out of bad situations. Rust generates so many good gaming stories that I have a journal full of them, and people edit their clips into movies -- with characters, plot, and stakes! -- on YouTube.

In the end, Rust is a sandbox. Your experience is in your hands. You chose your server -- sweaty, casual, roleplay, modded. You chose your goals, where you build your base, and what adventure to go on each time you leave. With perseverance, you will have satisfying wipes. You will eventually end a wipe rich in a fortress. Or you will finish building whatever fun, non-meta, roleplay thing you wanted - a trap base, a tower in the ocean, a farm, a car shop, a hotel, or even a haunted house. And you can accumulate several Discord servers worth of allies, willing to team up next wipe -- or right this moment, because you're getting raided! So get out there wearing your best gear, don't give up, and enjoy the journey.

252490;Rust;After 1700 hours, I still suck at this game.
252490;Rust;never played a lot, but watched hundreads videos
252490;Rust;R-U-S-T!
252490;Rust;The only fun thing about this game is the constant dick and balls, writing slurs on bases, and playing instruments. That's it, there's no other reason to play this dog shit.
252490;Rust;Naked women
252490;Rust;I spawn on the beach, excited for the wipe. So many fresh spawns running around, ready to get geared up. I hit my first tree and farm my first rock, until a bald black woman runs up to me shouting im a bald N**** woman and started spearing me in my genitalia. I spawn back on the beach only to get ear raped for someone who sounded 5 years old. Good game would play again.
252490;Rust;This game is so fun I love it when people call me slurs when I first installed this game I learned 3 new slurs within 10 seconds. 10/10 would recommend.
252490;Rust;Game stopped being fun after they made nighttime pitch black. Everyone is using the gamma trick to be able to see at night. Nobody can enforce the rules apparently, so anyone who's PC isn't compatible with the gamma trick is just unable to play a fair game. I can legit not get a base started in this game anymore because I die at night every single time to someone I can't even see. Totally unplayable, they need to either fix the gamma cheat or undue the update.
252490;Rust;dude some dude with wet socks came and asked if my gorilla petting zoo was open yet and I told him it was only applebees wings are 20% off?

252490;Rust;cool :)
252490;Rust;"Brutal unforgiving PVP game. Has a great map, good sound, decent graphics (slightly dated). Expect no sympathy from other players, in fact expect hostility and tricks and unfair gameplay. People will raid your base when you're offline, or bully you when you're online. If you like super aggressive always anxious PVP then this is the game for you. Of course there's a way for you to stay a bit hidden from others, build a base and gear, and get them before they get you.

I once played on a server where I was getting shot at left and right. I finally found a place to set up a small base, which got raided, but they didn't kill me, just destroyed my walls and took my stuff. Some other dude showed up and said sorry and gave me more gear and told me to keep playing and get good and encouraged me to keep playing and enjoy the game. Really nice guy. I used the weapon he gave me to kill him and take his gear, which was all amazing stuff. I became overcome by fear and paranoia that he'd come back so I ran and ran and ran that day, but they never found me. Out of fear I just logged onto a different server lol.

Everyone in Rust has stories about the people they meet or the fights or double crosses they get into.

Game is ok solo but shines playing with friends, the more the better, which helps overcome the feeling of being overpowered or uneven matches/skill differences. Very unforgiving for new or solo players. Just gotta keep playing, practice, etc.

There are some servers with PVP turned off, so there are places to play in some peace and just do PVE, but that's not really how the game is designed. But just know there are other ways to play, if you want to.

Not a game for me due to my tastes, but I recognize that it's otherwise an amazing game with a big community and lots of people just love it."

Random 3 AM loot inspections.
Paranoia of sounds that rival even the most seasoned meth head.
Man made architecture that could only be conjured by a schizophrenic.
A time machine that will consume your entire weekend.
You will feel like the victim of gang stalking at all times.
The clicking of stone on metal haunts your dreams.
Stare blankly into your furnace at night while eating a bowl of top ramen.
The situations you find your self in will become folk lore of your friend group.
The bad times will be recounted fondly with your friends.
The good times will be embellished to mythical levels.
God speed and may your wipe days be fruitful.

252490;Rust;i accidentally made a kid cry because i eco raided him. he then proceeded to call me the nword shortly after. great game.
252490;Rust;Do you love being called the N word? What about farming tons of supplies and losing it? Maybe even opening a door and getting  camped by a naked bald freshy? If these things sound fun to you then rust is your game! Bush campers and roof campers in every grid. Virgins around the map never getting off the game. Getting shot in the back every gun fight. Man rust is amazing, such a blast. Foreigners hacking and taking your loot or big teams grieving your base. If you like to break things like maybe a monitor or desk rust is for you.
252490;Rust;my girlfriend dumped me because i played too much
252490;Rust;My girlfriend who i play this game with said if I post a review on this and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that she will give me a bj so im just gonna leave this here. Help a brotha
252490;Rust;I live with constant fear :)
252490;Rust;Buy this game if you're looking to ruin your life.
252490;Rust;My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on rust: The Game and it gets 75 likes and 20 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
252490;Rust;This is not a game, this is an alternative existence. You will love it and hate it, you will dream about it, you will think of everything in terms of Scrap and Sulphur.
252490;Rust;This game consumed my life , I’ve left my wife ,abandoned the kids, dropped out of school , quit work , quit showers and daily activities to sit at my pc in my mothers basement all day to play rust 22 hours a day. Needless to say I smell like dick cheese but I have rust so it makes it ok. Rust is love rust is life. I highly recommend this game.
252490;Rust;I am a 45 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game immediately after release. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.
252490;Rust;"Rust has a reputation for being toxic, but in my opinion that's because all new players go straight to the high-pop official servers and immediately get rekt by the rude kids who play there. If you try some of the thousands of community/modded servers you will soon find a very pleasant gaming experience if that's what you prefer.

Another thing to note is that Rust retains it popularity year after year because it's constantly evolving and improving. There is a feature update every single month, it keeps players coming back for more."

252490;Rust;"This game has ruined my life. I have never felt more isolated from my friends and family and feel more depressed than ever before. I have slept with my headset on every night for the past 3 years causing the bone structure in my skull to be permanently damaged. I get 3 and a half hours of sleep every night which resulted in a rare disorder where my height is stunted and i am unable to digest food. I weigh about 240 pounds and im 4'3"". I hear echoes from the depths of hell, grabbing at my ankles to drag me down to the demons that i have upset in my past life. My walls scream at me as I beam retards from the top of oil rig. I hear footsteps when i sleep and the explosions of rockets haunt my nightmares. every therapist and doctor ive seen has tried to lock me into a psych ward, but you are not allowed to bring in electronics, so there is no way to see if I am being raided and I will miss at least three force wipes (months for normies) which is completely unacceptable. I fear now more than ever that my sins will catch up to me, and I will live a life down bad and #PrimLocked in the darkest pit of the universe with nothing but the rust theme song repeating in my ears over and over and over and over again. 5/10 its worth it if you get it at sale. thank you for all the points<3 this game is still fucking horrible"
252490;Rust;10/10 if hate chocolate people i was black got call n word i built a wood base then got rocket raided and call n word they let me live and put me in a cell i dident know you could comit suisde but they would walk by and call me the n word then made me fight of black people wih my rock and told me to eat the dead peoples meat Recomend if your character is not black
252490;Rust;No one reads the reviews anyway, so I will write that I am gay
252490;Rust;If your vision of paradise is being called the n word by 10 year olds as they destroy a weeks worth of grinding, this game is perfect for you.
252490;Rust;"Lets start off with the fact that this game is like a full time job and herion addiction all in one. no other game in the world demand 12+ hours a day to make any progess, not to include the fact that you lose everything after sometime between a week and a month. I was written up twice at work sue to being late defending online raids, to which i was put in a stick situation and thought the correct answer to skate by was ""my fault, K12 wouldnt fuck off, maybe be a bit more understanding next time. Just to come home from work, and get smoked by 12+ man clans causing me to want to take a newborn puppy and repeatedly slam it into the sidewalk listening to it whimper and it pleasing my cruel thoughts that are heavily induced by this monstrosity of a game. There needs to be studies behind the reason a game such as rust is so addicting, yet so suicide inticing, rate it 3 sweaty no life fat fucks out of 10."
252490;Rust;i have had many things done to me that noone should experience. and have been called the N word counterless times
252490;Rust;Can Eat Human Meat But Can't Drink Gasoline.
252490;Rust;Escape while you can!!! Don't get trapped in this hell hole. before you know it, youre kids, wife, family will have left you. Once you start, there is no going back. You will stay a virgin for life, become fat as hell and maybe even retarded!!!
252490;Rust;This is game is amazing but... for me an upgrade in the graphics and shooting physics like CS would be the best game ever!!!
252490;Rust;How I feel when I play this game, in order: :steamhappy: :steambored: :steammocking: :steamfacepalm: :steamsalty: :steamsad:
252490;Rust;Very friendly environment 100% recommend =)

252490;Rust;You play as a solo and make the best plays but never keep the loot because of big groups. So you realize unless you dedicate your life to the game you wont progress. 10/10 or -10/10 depends on the day

252490;Rust;Rust is a wild ride where you start naked, dodge falling trees, and negotiate with neighbours who think they're Vikings. Building is a sitcom, meeting strangers is a comedy sketch, and your dignity is optional. If you're up for chaos, laughs, and questioning your life choices, Rust is the hilarious roller coaster you need. Just remember your virtual sunscreen – it's a wild world out there!

252490;Rust;"Rust: the most difficult shooter. You need a high tolerance for digital pain. It's hard enough to progress from naked on the beach to bows, hard to get from bows to guns, and hard to stay alive long enough to keep them. Servers have zero matchmaking, and so you will get killed by sneaky shotgun grubs, head-clicking chads, and huge zerg groups, usually after you've acquired a full inventory of loot. Other players will be toxic trash talkers, backstabbing liars, and ruthless raiders. The most mundane activities like chopping wood, filling a water jug, or even walking out your front door can be fatal. Any time you log on, raiders could have blown holes in your base and taken all your stuff while you slept IRL -- or they might confidently fight their way in while you're online and defending! Every play has a counter play, but you are always rolling the dice. I think of Rust like a slower Battle Royale - it's not over one session; it's over several days, where you build a base (or two or three), then accumulate (and lose) gear as you upgrade your humble hut into a fortress.

It's hard to think of a shooter with higher stakes. You miss one arrow or one bullet and you lose your base to raiders. You make one bad decision and your team wipes, instead of coming home with the other team's loot. You stay out too long and you get swarmed by opportunists who heard the chance to get rich in the sound of distant gunshots. You shoot the wrong people from your roof, and you make enemies who raid you. You run back to your base at the wrong time, and your enemies learn where you live and raid you. You pick the wrong base to raid and you get nothing in return, instead of a huge payout. You raid recklessly and you blow yourself up -- or somebody comes along and steals your hard won loot and explosives from you. You make one mistake in building your base and raiders exploit it. The learning curve is a cliff. Your naivety, perfectionism, inattention to detail, passivity, and recklessness will get better, one painful loss at a time.

The challenge makes victory so much sweeter. Sometimes, you stumble across a giant brawl with one gamer standing, kill him while he's teabagging, and take ALL the loot home. Sometimes, your raids make you rich -- your raid, or the one you steal from another team. Sometimes, you lose over and over, but progress in drips and drabs anyway. Sometimes, it's the small victories, like stealing a clan's boat -- or helicopter. Sometimes your mind games work and gamers think you're too poor to be worth raiding or blame somebody else for the trouble you caused them. Sometimes, your diplomacy works and you find allies to help defend you from raids -- or to raid the baddest group, together. It's a magical feeling, when you close the front door to your base and know you've made it home safe, with the spoils of your latest adventure. Rust rewards your game knowledge, awareness, strategy, decision-making, teamwork, and patience like no shooter I've ever played.

Rust is a game of authentic, emergent gameplay. The PvE is laughably thin; PvP *is* the content. The maps are huge and procedural, where most structures are made by other gamers, not level designers. Even the static points of interest feel different when the surrounding terrain and player bases change from wipe to wipe. Where you build a base and the personalities of your neighbors makes each wipe a unique experience. A hostile fortress in the wrong spot can ruin your plans - whether by walling off the sulfur quarry you were hoping to mine or mercilessly sniping you as you pass - forcing you to adapt. Do use your mic! Though it opens you to toxicity, it also gives you the chance to make allies, mess with people's heads, and even talk your way out of bad situations. Rust generates so many good gaming stories that I have a journal full of them, and people edit their clips into movies -- with characters, plot, and stakes! -- on YouTube.

In the end, Rust is a sandbox. Your experience is in your hands. You chose your server -- sweaty, casual, roleplay, modded. You chose your goals, where you build your base, and what adventure to go on each time you leave. With perseverance, you will have satisfying wipes. You will eventually end a wipe rich in a fortress. Or you will finish building whatever fun, non-meta, roleplay thing you wanted - a trap base, a tower in the ocean, a farm, a car shop, a hotel, or even a haunted house. And you can accumulate several Discord servers worth of allies, willing to team up next wipe -- or right this moment, because you're getting raided! So get out there wearing your best gear, don't give up, and enjoy the journey.

252490;Rust;After 1700 hours, I still suck at this game.
252490;Rust;never played a lot, but watched hundreads videos
252490;Rust;R-U-S-T!
252490;Rust;The only fun thing about this game is the constant dick and balls, writing slurs on bases, and playing instruments. That's it, there's no other reason to play this dog shit.
252490;Rust;Naked women
252490;Rust;I spawn on the beach, excited for the wipe. So many fresh spawns running around, ready to get geared up. I hit my first tree and farm my first rock, until a bald black woman runs up to me shouting im a bald N**** woman and started spearing me in my genitalia. I spawn back on the beach only to get ear raped for someone who sounded 5 years old. Good game would play again.
252490;Rust;This game is so fun I love it when people call me slurs when I first installed this game I learned 3 new slurs within 10 seconds. 10/10 would recommend.
252490;Rust;Game stopped being fun after they made nighttime pitch black. Everyone is using the gamma trick to be able to see at night. Nobody can enforce the rules apparently, so anyone who's PC isn't compatible with the gamma trick is just unable to play a fair game. I can legit not get a base started in this game anymore because I die at night every single time to someone I can't even see. Totally unplayable, they need to either fix the gamma cheat or undue the update.
252490;Rust;dude some dude with wet socks came and asked if my gorilla petting zoo was open yet and I told him it was only applebees wings are 20% off?
252490;Rust;I just hit 1K hours and i could have learned a new language, could have learned a new sport, could have found a girlfriend, but i sat at my pc and played rust. I dont regret a single second i put in this game
