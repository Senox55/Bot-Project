730;Counter-Strike 2;After 8 years playing it, I didn't improve my skills in-game.However, I learned new language skills: now I can curse in Russian and Brazilian Portuguese.Also, my tolerance level to guttural screams and loud sounds was increased.Now I can bear the crying of my children for longer and I can make them feel better by singing sweet traditional songs from other cultures, such as Очи чёрные (Dark Eyes) or Garota de Ipanema (The Girl from Ipanema).In conclusion, Counter Strike transformed me into a better father and a better person, in addition to making me more patient, tolerant to hateful people and more trained in languages and cultures.Better than any psychiatric therapy. 10/10

730;Counter-Strike 2;In order to play this game you need to be the wolf. You need to know how to howl, in fact you need to be capable of howling at will, unleash that warrior howl with your mind. Then eat raw meat, learn to adore having your fur stroked and PREY ON THE SHEEP! Because we thrive in a land where the strong prey on the weak and that's called natural selection, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A WOLF. Don't let the sheep's bleating prevent you from enacting your genetic will, YOU MUST GNAW ON THEM. Tear them strip by strip and show them that the Úlfhéðnar do not take thralls.

730;Counter-Strike 2;I've been a long time player of counterstrike. I was known as Stumpsy or sTuMpS, I was born with a disability (no hands) and I stumbled across CSGO around 2013. I was obviously really bad when I first started and only played CS as a casual game with friends who were much better than me. It wasn't until I started messing around with mouse/keyboard settings that changed everything for me. I discovered the setting Raw Mouse Input on/off and for me, not being able to pick up the mouse with no fingers, what this setting did literally changed the way I was able to play and literally accelerated gameplay for me. If I flicked fast in a direction I was able to navigate around maps and aim without having to lift my mouse off the pad. So say if I was turning right it would be a fast flick to right, back to center, fast flick to right again etc. Doing this I could basically do a full 360 within like 3-4 swipes. If i had raw mouse input turned on, that setting negates as it only follows where the mouse moves. It really bummed me out that removing this setting has pretty much ended my entire csgo gaming experience and considering they deleted csgo altogether with the replacement of CS2. I was looking forward to playing the game with friends and I've tried so many different setting to try and replicate what raw mouse input did for me. This game was the only fps game that offered a setting like that and its the only reason I stuck around playing csgo for so many years. It sucks watching all your friends play without you and it sucks feeling like you can no longer enjoy a game that gave you so much joy for so many years. I hope the devs at Valve see this and add the setting back into the game.I have included a video explaining how I play and why mouse raw is so important for me.and another video of my twitch compilations to show off actual gameplay.

730;Counter-Strike 2;No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it. When you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.You win or you learn, you never lose.Edit: Source 2 is still not out. You can play on 128 tick rate servers on third party clients like FaceIt, ESEA, 5E Play etc.

730;Counter-Strike 2;so after near 2k time play, I'm  gonna say some wordsFirst: don't get disappointed so easily u will get better Second: don't get mad against  your  friends your friends are always better against you just because ...Third: don't get mad at all u will lose your focus afterward gameFourth: u are good at your rank don't let  anyone ruin your fun just try to get betterFifth: u will face some unhealthy players that make your blood boil Sixth: don't buy cheats just don't seventh: u will meet player on the high rank that use cheat and pay for cheat monthly higher than ur salary after all, I don't know just be  wise
730;Counter-Strike 2;I started playing this game when I started to get depressed IRL.I made a lot of friends and got to know that I was actually a likeable human being.People seemed to be happy and excited to play with me.I called them friends and they helped me simply by existing and being happy with me.I grew confident, learnt I was actually a bit fun to talk with.This game made me discover myself and I forever will be thankful for that.The thing that makes this game what it is are the people, you'll meet a LOT of them it's upto you to choose who to keep playing with and who to forget and forgive.The people i met through this game are some of my lifelong friends and I am lucky to have those friends.I may not play this game everyday now but this game holds a dear and special place in my heart.At the final moments of this game I edit this to say, thanks for everything you have done for me.It may be just a game for many but for me it was one of the way to escape from my reality, to get to meet some of my life long friends and to get to know the world and myself more.Thanks ,From the most Bottom and sincere part of my heart.I will always miss and remember the time I have spent with a big smile.
730;Counter-Strike 2;Please fix the anticheat I'm tired of cheaters in all games.Faceit can do it, Valorant can do it, ( Well make it alot harder )

730;Counter-Strike 2;This is the gaming equivalent of a toxic relationship that you can never get away from.
730;Counter-Strike 2;"Fun game overall, though it may at times consume too much of your day time.You will come across many toxic-salty people, just ignore-report-mute them. You will have days that you may play like a pro and feel good and your dopamine will skyrocket, but you will be accused of cheating by your ""victims"".you will have days that you can't even get a shot and you will be told to possibly cease to exist and delete this game possibly something about your close relatives but as I said in my second point, ignore-mute-report whatever you dont like.Enjoy this game, be less toxic, obviously don't cheat what would be the point.

Have a  Microphon and use it.Warmup before Competitive Games. Doesn't matter if you kill 1000 Bots on an Aim-Map or play Deathmatch for about 20 Minutes.Practice all necessary skills for the Game- AIM -> Deathmatch; Aim-Maps; Practice-Maps (Recoilmaster etc.)- Movement -> Climb-servers; Surfing, Prefire-Maps (Shortcuts from Yesber too)- Gamesense -> Matchmaking; Retake-Servers- Mapknowledge -> Callouts; Demos from your favourite Pro-Player,- Nades -> pls learn them- Roles -> Entry; Support; Lurk; AWPer- Train your Habit (first callout then flame)- play daily to to improve your aim- make pauses every 2-3 games to reset (go outside from the room with your Pc)- stop at the point you get mad (after a loss may)If you follow all these Steps you will be able to climb the ladder and improve fast.Have a nice day and start fraggin! P.S.: Last Step: Get friends to play with and play for the win not for stats!!!"

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.Actually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.Edit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.EDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge ""fan"" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a ""Noob"" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.This review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.Reviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't."

730;Counter-Strike 2;"I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.It was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. Some years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. We formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.However, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.I've seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called ""CS Promod"" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.After a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm's ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. CS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro's do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol' days (from what i've read).Though it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. Since all those years i've tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. If you're looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.However if you're looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.I hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community.

570;Dota 2;This isn't a free game. Each match cost you a bit of your sanity until you have nothing left.
570;Dota 2;"If you told me when I started playing dota 2 at 18 years old that I would be reviewing this game after 8 years and 13'000 hours, I would have laughed at you.Let me put that into perspective:  Of dota 2. I'm almost 26 now, and I don't really know what to think of this game. This game has had a large impact on my life. I was ""addicted"" to the experience, in ranked and matchmaking. I've learned a lot about myself and others. I've learned a lot about staying in charge of my emotions. I've also learned that emotions can easily lose you a game before its come to its conclusion. I've learned how to react instinctively to changing pixel colours.But I've also relatively learned nothing.Not to depress anyone reading this, but when I put all of this into perspective, thinking about what could have been, I could easily imagine how much better my life would be if I never started playing this game. Socially, I would have a stronger network. My education and eventual career would probably have had more longevity (I have played professionally as a dota 2 player, but grew a lack of interest in competing). But I can never be sure how drastic these differences are. Would the pros outweigh the cons? I have certainly met and interacted with a large group of people,  of dota2, at events, tournaments etc. Any dota 2 player that has sunk 2000 hours or so has probably had these thoughts: ""what if I just did ... instead"" or ""what if I just played on a more casual level"". The issue is, that dota  more rewarding than other things, and that's a trap I fell into.It is with a heavy heart that I admit that I don't think I can bring myself to play anymore. Took a long 8 years for me to grow out of this perfect fit, which is why I must review dota2 positively.Thank you for all that you  done for me. Farewell friend."

570;Dota 2;"Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over  the span of 3 years.1. general thoughts and how i started:I was  15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of impact  this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that  saying ""nothing"" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. Did i waste my youth?:So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt  that it wouldve made a big difference. You gotta  be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts ""lets learn music""  or ""lets study"" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to improve, that whole dimension of ""improving"" wasnt even there for me. I just went to school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing. Dota changed that.3. time invested into dota2:EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought of ""oh man i shouldve learned something  with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."" at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for  school again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you  will be a top student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start  understanding how to farm -> M .  M . R YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are OK(kinda good, not great)). ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive)"
570;Dota 2;Do you have depression? Do you have anxiety? Do you get sporadic panic attacks throughout the day? Are you a racist, xenophobe who knows how to curse in 12 different languages? Do you and your friends fight all the time? Are you addicted to nicotine? Fear not. This game will give you all the above.
570;Dota 2;This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.Then it taught me to hate them all.
570;Dota 2;After 5000 hours I realized that there were not 9 idiots in each match, but 10.
570;Dota 2;If you want to have a great life with jobs, moneys, girl, etc, don't play this game.
570;Dota 2;This isn't a free game every match costs a piece of ur sanity until you are left with nothing but regret.

570;Dota 2;This game might be good but I need to play more before I can say anything.
570;Dota 2;Causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourette's syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. Would definitely recommend.

570;Dota 2;This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.Then it taught me to hate them all.
570;Dota 2;It feels so good when you finally Uninstall DOTA2
570;Dota 2;I recommend everyone to play Dota 2 and not LoL nor Mobile LegendsDon't get me wrong, I am not hating or anything. I was from Dota 1 for like 3-4 years before Dota 2 was released and it didn't caught my attention to adapt the new theme of it.Dota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.Dota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..This game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.All in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.P.S. Calm down, it's just a game...... YAWA!
570;Dota 2;Skipped classes thanks to Dota.Learned to gamble thanks to Dota.Learned to swear in 12 different languages thanks to Dota.Became racist thanks to Dota.All in all, Ruin your life simulator. 10/10 would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself. Cancer can be cured,SEA Dota community can't be.
570;Dota 2;Learnt russian, indonesian, tagalog and more. better than duolingo 10/10
570;Dota 2;In Dota 2,Not many people speak your language.Not many people play well.Not many people talk nicely.Not many people work as a team.But if you find people that do...You'll have the most fun you've ever had.
570;Dota 2;I was verbally assaulted
570;Dota 2;"It's like roulette; fun until it turns into Russian"
570;Dota 2;"""THE PUB SUPPORT""""Where are wards?"" The pub Carry demanded. ""I placed them and they were countered"" the Support began, ""I am trying to juggle giving you complete lane farm, protecting you and harrassing the enemy while saving to buy more, also possibly sentries to remove their-"" ""UP COUR PLS"" the mid hero politely added.""Give Savle"" The Carry demanded. ""Certainly."" replies the support, using the salve on the Carry who subsequently ran headlong into an enemy creepwave. ""So where is mek?"" the Carry said, after he was ganked due to overextending. The Support died saving him and was treated to a rather enthusiastic series of map pings on his corpse.""Again, having not even enough to buy boots as well as wards, I don't think a 7 minute Mek is viable."" The Support replies.""Haha look your level, so low, noob"" the Carry retorted. ""U have no item xaxa"".""Well, jungle gold and experience through stacking and pulling with blocked camps is nowhere near as much as on lane which I attempted to give you, the carry, the priority over.""The Carry is subsequently ganked again at the enemy tower, oblivious to the enemy tp that the Support moved away from. ""Report Support, usless"" The carry cried in allchat, in between mentioning various aspects of the Support's Mother's anatomy.""Instead of reporting and acting like that, why don't you try supporting for randoms sometime instead of instapicking a carry?"" the Support asked, as he watched the Carry return to afk-lasthitting lane creeps.""HAH, support is for noskill noobs like you!"""
570;Dota 2;I feel old now :(
570;Dota 2;Sorry I don't speak English.I only speak: Arabic, German, Hebrew, Spanish, French, Italian, Portugese, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, Urdu, Finnish, Yiddish, Turkish, Russian, and Farsi.
570;Dota 2;Better language learning app than Duolingo.
570;Dota 2;best game in the galaxy, but you have to play with the worst species in the galaxy.
570;Dota 2;Do you have depression? Do you have anxiety? Do you get sporadic panic attacks throughout the day? Are you a racist, xenophobe who knows how to curse in 12 different languages? Do you and your friends fight all the time? Are you addicted to nicotine? Fear not. This game will give you all the above.
570;Dota 2;"DotA 2 Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return.DotA 2 Will make you regret ever playing it,  and yet you will always think ""Just one more game""DotA 2 Will take away all your free time, and yet you'll almost feel proud of how many hours you have in DotA 2.With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2. But you won't.You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking. Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just becomes natural to you.If you start playing this game, you  become addicted.You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a wallet emptying one too.tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become an angry person.Basically 10/10 GOTY All years"
570;Dota 2;The best game to play if you are suicidal or hate your life all together
570;Dota 2;Causes anxiety problems, low self esteem, Tourette's syndrome, mood swings, Bipolar disorder, breakdown of relationships, raging erections, racism. Would definitely recommend
570;Dota 2;Very nice game with a considerable number of toxic players. Ruins your life. Don't play if you want to live a normal life.

570;Dota 2;Four Types of Damage in Dota2: 1. Physical2. Magical3. Pure4. Brain
570;Dota 2;In this game you can:1- Murderer trees2- Kill an ancient creature chilling in his cave without mercy and and steal his cheese3- Learn at least 9 different languages in every single match4- Kill others players for no apparent reason5- Can develop erectile dysfunction due to extended seated hours
570;Dota 2;One of the best and most influential games ever and a game very near and dear to my heart. Please don't play it.There is NOTHING more satisfying in this world then winning a 1 hour + length match in this game. Both teams get extremely personal with each other, both teams doing everything in their power to make sure that time spent belongs to them, there will be a couple of central characters in the match who just dominate the battlefield and both teams are doing everything to make sure that character can come through and do their job.♥♥♥♥ sex, ♥♥♥♥ money, ♥♥♥♥ fame. In that one moment, when you win, you feel like the whole world is yours and the people you might have never ever been friendly with, suddenly can turn into great friends the moment after that victory.Its incredible and I haven't seen a game that is able to create these miracle situations as often as this one does. But thats the whole problem with this game, to get that situation you need a well balanced match, you need decent team mates, you need personal will power and skill, and you need time. If ANY of those things don't line up, you are in for a massive ♥♥♥♥ show. I can't even tell you at this point how many terrible matches I have had. Its terrible for your mental health. Even when you finally get decent at the game, there will always be better people and you are still playing a team game. Its depressing and you constantly have to be confronted with that playing this game. In a way its humbling and great for self growth, but in another way its absolutely unhealthy and that kind of mental torture is something people shouldn't subject themselves to.Even after reaching immortal multiple times there is still so much room for improvement. As I grow older I just see myself losing access to that kind of time constantly. In the past 5 hours of free time was nothing and I wouldn't grow tired of it at all. But now I have responsibilities and people needing my help, a 40 minute match is something daunting when you get to that point.You just end up wishing you could pause the game like with single player games or wondering if you couldn't spend the hours in Dota to finish up playing other games you wanted to play. This isn't just a long game, its an infinite game where you are the deciding factor on when to stop, depending on the type of person you are, that stopping point might take a long ass time like it did for me.When I started this game I was a mess of a person, I had barely any friends, I was terrified of talking to other people on the mic and the only thing I cared about was winning and getting better. Once I got even a little better I would tell people what to do in a horrible way and expect them to listen and even thank me for the insults I threw at them.I learned from all of that and improved myself as a person, I got a lot more empathetic, learned how to talk like a heartfelt leader, learned how to socially make fun and talk to people and got much better at critical thinking and problem solving.But as I look back, I just wonder if there wasn't a better way to go about it, words can't describe the extreme lows Dota can put you in. Dota shaped me as a person and helped me a lot, but for everything it helped me with, it equally took away a lot as well. No matter how much I love this game, I could never recommend this to someone I don't know very well and that I KNOW could handle this game normally. This game has the potential to take so much from you. Play it at your own discretion and make sure you know what you are getting yourself into.
570;Dota 2;This isn't a free game. Each match costs you a bit of your sanity until you have nothing left!
570;Dota 2;community is very rude to new players and report you just for not doing well. game can be fun but the community completely ruins the experience.
570;Dota 2;Skipped classes thanks to Dota.Learned to gamble thanks to Dota.Learned to swear in 12 different languages thanks to Dota.Became racist thanks to Dota.All in all, Ruin your life simulator. 10/10 would recommend if you are trying to kill yourself.

570;Dota 2;If you are worried your children are doing drugs, show them this game. They will be too busy fulfilling their innermost masochistic desires while hopelessly right clicking that they will not have the time for drugs or friends or anything else really.
570;Dota 2;You either quit while you are the feeder or play long enough to see yourself become toxic.
570;Dota 2;Nice game, bad community.

570;Dota 2;The heroes are a joke.The patches are a joke.This game is a joke,but hey after putting in 3000 hours into this,my life is a joke.10/10 would recommend if you hate yourself and like to cry yourself to sleep
570;Dota 2;life has been ruined
570;Dota 2;"There is a lot to be said about Dota 2. The most important thing you should know:The game is wonderful and very kind to beginners ... While they are in the menu.The community is not only positive, but also possesses the skills of telepathy. They will say many things about your relatives which you never even imagined to be true but they are the smart bunch you should listen or you will not get very far in this game.Also, one of the advantages is that many doctors, physicians play Dota 2 and they can diagnose your mental and physical abilities without any problems.It is thanks to Dota 2 that you can finally find your long-lost father or find out that your mother loved spending time with many wonderful men from this game behind you back)If you want to play Dota with a friend, it is better that you are physically stronger than him, because after a couple of dozen matches you will want to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of himIf your team won, it is only thanks to your divine skill.If you lost, then only because the team of stupid clowns, you carried the game as best you could.In Dota, the most important thing is to find a scapegoat only to justify that you were playing ""allegedly good"" but others are the scum but you only you are the ""pro"" you are the carry you are the best you lose only because gaben sends secret agents to ruin your game if not gaben you've would have had 7k mmrBe sure to remember how the support stole one last hit from you, or how you were left alone without a farm. As a mid-lane, staying afk for 15 minutes and no ss or gang while the enemies humiliated your team. In cases of complaints against you, this will help to bring a counter-argument in your favor. IT is better for them to find a scapegoat from the very beginning and start slowly presenting him for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that he allegedly ruined.Although i advice you not to tilt or blame someone even if they are bad or ruining the game because you will be the one who will get all the reports in this game no one likes smartassesDon't try to play Dota for fun, it's almost impossible. After a certain number of games, even victories will not please you.Only balanced gameplay no more 6 hours a day will help you not to get raged always make breaks from this game as long as you needDon't try to eliminate dota entirely from your life that will crush youmake friends with it and play how you desire not how gaben imagined it for youDota matchmaking is made strictly to maintain balance so if you had interest for high rating absent skill forget itDon't count numbers play for yourself valv always gonna find way to ♥♥♥♥ you"

(my tears are falling while i'm writing these words ) recently i reached the age of 24 and i realized that i'm a loser and its time to give up on this dream and say goodbye to dota 2. but i never wanted to leave here without any words being said.thanks for reading this comment , i wish all of you guys reach top LeaderBoards and become e-sport tier 1 players.Gg Wp , Watsonlee."

570;Dota 2;No denying this GAME IS BEAUTIFUL and the Veteran community is very UNDERSTANDING. I had achieved what People find very hard to do in their Lives. I had quit Dota for over 2 years. It was a MISTAKE RETURNING to the game. But here I was, teaching a friend.It really felt like DOTA had become a very player friendly in the past 2 years. It took a day or two to get back to normal DOTA playing habit. I was playing UNRANKED and It felt good, I was on a roll. Playing tens of games a day. Slowly realising it's pulling me back. And then all of a sudden I had an urge to press the RANKED button which had a new Roles option. I played my first ranked game as a Shadow Demon (A support), won my lane and surprisingly had a narrow win. My team did not know how my hero or the items worked. The feeling was different. At first I just thought these people in my team are just miserable turd burglars but No I was wrong. They made what would be a simple game to an absolute sh%#hole of a game to be in.If I say that the next few games had given me the trashiest people in the entire universe, it would be an understatement. I HAD NEVER FELT WORSE. First, they cannot be reasoned with. Secondly, the amount of flame, rage and incessant ramblings I discovered in these games was overwhelmingly DEMEANING. People flaming to the point you have NO CHOICE BUT TO ABANDON.I stopped my RANKED venture and went for a NORMAL one and boy did it kept getting worse. I'll tell you guys it's EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to enrage me, but here I was getting angry at these creatures, Raising my voice to my newbie Friend who had now loved the game but eventually agreed It was time for us to stop. In just a couple of days I went from being a perfectly reasonable, calm & friendly personality who would encourage people if they are playing bad to being an absolutely miserable person with anger issues screaming and yelling etc. 2 days Ago I uninstalled the game. I still don't know why  I have these mixed thoughts. I have spent a decent amount of time to understand how the game mechanics works and quite honestly would like to summarize that I have wasted an important part my childhood, jeopardised my mental health on several occasions, had a fight with my father over this stupid game and overall took a giant dump on my Life and guess what I still love this game.I wouldn't wish this on anyone and would sincerely recommend every player to take care of themselves, Don't waste too much time on this game. If you win or lose  doesn't matter, take a break, go out for a walk. Call your family & friends. Confirm that you aren't that same miserable person from that game that stupid game you play.The community has somewhat grown up from 2014. My rank opening game. A bloodseeker screaming on his mic and typing a rant every 2 seconds for 45 minutes flaming his teamates. I still remember how shi%%y it felt to this day. It was not worth it back then, Its not worth it now.And to any person coming here... .
570;Dota 2;all you get is mental damage
570;Dota 2;Trying to learn this game takes a while and having people constantly insult you while you're stumbling through trying to learn just makes it all not worth it. Fun to watch, though.

570;Dota 2;If you're new... this might help and it definitely helped for me. Take advantage of the great pve aspect to Dota~- Download a custom AI script from the workshop page... I recommend Adam's/Ranked AI script and Bot Experiment.- Just practice against bots at first. Set your team as hard level while the enemy team is easy. Do that until you get a general feel for the game and can consistently win.- Then... bump it up~ so do hard vs medium... then hard vs hard... then hard vs unfair...- Once you are consistently winning bot matches with hard level teammate bots vs unfair enemy bots... start decreasing your team's level~ this is where training wheels come off haha.- Do medium vs unfair... and see if you can consistently win.- Eventually~ you'll come to easy vs unfair and this basically forces you to really know how your hero and Dota works if you want to consistently win.- Once you're at the easy teammate bots vs unfair enemy bots and can win consistently... try to do it across various carry heroes.- After doing this enough... you should know how every hero works... their power spikes... how items work... how to adapt against different heroes... etc~ if you're at this point then try pvp and you'll be better off than a majority of new players who decided to learn during the game versus doing their research before playing.*Remember that bot games can potentially teach bad habits but~ you'll at least learn key concepts to Dota with laning... how to control your lane... power spikes... how fragile or tanky a hero is... what each hero does and their abilities... items... how to rotate aka split push or not... early game versus late game... etc~ familiarity matters more versus actually winning the bot games. Sure you can cheese your way to victory like with playing Crystal Maiden and other supports as hard carries but that isn't the goal... the goal is to understand how the game works and become familiar with it.*This training method only teaches you how to play carries... if you're looking to learn how to play supports or in general what are called position 3 to 5 heroes aka heroes who will have less farm in an actual game... this method won't quite work. But imo it's important that players understand how carries work because everything else follows through from there. Dota is about playing off your carries as they statistically will be the strongest heroes late game so learning support/noncarry roles will come easier in real games.♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡Pros~- So much depth and variety. There are always new strategies... no match will ever feel the same and requires different approaches... it's why people can main this game as the skill cap is nearly infinite and your knowledge and decision making will always be growing. And it's also why people generally don't feel bored with the game... it just always feels fresh and new and it's why I managed to play 200+ hours with literally only custom ai bots.- Every hero feels unique to play and so you'll likely be able to find different gameplay styles you like but also get a chance to just always have different ways to play and have fun.- The item system provides a lot of customizable ways to play your heroes or to adapt to the enemy and their strategies. - Like in Paladins... there is a balanced ecosystem/counters to heroes but with room for skill to allow outplays against hard counters.Cons~- Extremely high learning curve. This is the general issue with moba games unlike fps games because it really takes a lot of knowledge to learn how the 118 heroes or so work along with hundreds of items. Add in mechanics like magical resistance/magical damage vs physical damage... etc~- A very team role reliant game generally speaking... sure in bot games you can 1 vs 9 basically but~ in real games you really need to hope everyone is holding up to their roles. If your carries don't know how to last hit or farm or take advantage of pushes or picks... there is nothing you can do about it as a noncarry. Sure you can do your best to literally spoon feed them the best you can... but it's how it is. This isn't Paladins or something where you can potentially become a damage/support hybrid... in Dota 2 as a support you'll be limited based on statistics of how you just simply won't gain as much attack speed or damage over time compared to enemy carries.- The drafting stage to games is important... aka what heroes you all pick will really determine how a game goes. This is both a good and bad thing as it makes for example watching dota games really fun to see which heroes are picked but for players... this means a team that mindlessly picks will get punished. Not only do you need the traditional position 1 to 5 role of hard carry > hard/semi carry > semi carry/offlane > soft support > hard support... but some heroes might not work the best with each other. ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡ ♡Overall~ super fun game and it can be played super seriously with rank and the professional scene but super casual with playing random games or just only bots like I did. Like I had so much fun against just bots. Only issue is the learning curve~
570;Dota 2;Best game ever!
570;Dota 2;"I've played this game for years nonstop.  Over 8k hours logged (not even joking).  And I'm gonna tell you: at this point, the game's just not worth playing anymore.  I think it hasn't been worth playing for a year or two now, but I'm only just starting to realize it.  It breaks my heart to say that, but that's just the truth of the matter.=====The Good=====Dota 2 is a wonderfully complex and intricate strategy game, with mechanics that are honestly rather simple, but require a steep learning curve to even begin to master.  The graphics are solid.  The voice acting of the characters is thoroughly enjoyable.  The capacity to play this game any way you please, so long as you win, is one of the most exciting and fulfilling aspects of it.  What's more, the fact that it's 100% free--so long as you don't feel a deep, unyielding need for cosmetics--makes it almost the perfect game.Almost.=====The Bad=====Matchmaking is an absolute dumpster fire.  In my over 8,000 hours of playing the game, I have not even ONCE griefed my team or intentionally fed.  Team play and integrity is that important to me.  Yet, be that as it may, I routinely now get matched up with griefers.  People who throw a tantrum and start intentionally dying to give the enemy team free gold and experience.  Or buy up all the wards and place them around fountain / in the middle of trees, where they give no vision.  Or just AFK jungle and hoard as many neutral items as they can.  Or even just hide in the trees to soak experience so that they don't get an abandon, but otherwise contribute nothing.  This occurs in both unranked matchmaking AND ranked matchmaking.  Every single day.  Years ago, this would ALMOST NEVER happen in ranked games, and only SOMETIMES happened in unranked games.  Now it's absolutely rampant.To make matters worse, ever since Valve implemented a ""buddy"" score--that is, an internal rating to judge who would be friendly to new players so that they had a better experience--the vast majority of my games have me teamed up with people vastly below my skill level.  By its very nature, Dota 2 is a competitive game.  For me, the attraction was the ability to test myself and push myself harder, so that I might face better and better opponents until I felt challenged and fulfilled.  Years ago, I had that.  Recently, however--that is, the past two to three years--my experience in that regard has been a massive pile of flaming hot garbage.  Fewer than 10% of the games I play feel genuinely challenging.  The remaining 90% or so of the games I play are just steamrolls because the people on my team or the other team are just so bad, comparatively.Until Valve implements some sort of actual controls on the matchmaking for competitive play, I can't recommend this game in any sort of good conscience.  It advertises itself as a highly-competitive team game, yet it's clear to me that their matchmaking system does sweet FA to actually implement that experience.  I once loved this game, and thoroughly enjoyed the competitive atmosphere it had.  Now, it just pisses me off.If you're just looking to goof around, then this is the game for you.  However, if you're looking for an actual competitive experience?  Look elsewhere.  Somewhere along the line, this game's system for evaluating skill levels and pairing people up accordingly fell apart, and the developers either don't realize it, or don't care.EDIT:  Apparently, a lot of pros on the scene agree with this assessment.  I didn't even realize it until doing some searching after this review, but according to syndereN, the amount of griefing in public matches is ""the worst [it's] ever been in 15 years, and it's not even close""."
570;Dota 2;It's a great game, but don't let the toxicity get to you and don't be toxic yourself.
570;Dota 2;This is not a game that is healthy to play unless you are a happy and well-adjusted person.And it will probably make you into an unhappy and poorly adjusted person.

252490;Rust;So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.
252490;Rust;Rust is a game. If you like...-Sleeping-Feeling happiness-Being intimate with women-Maintaining a relationship with your family-Breathing fresh air-Having friendsIt is not your game.
252490;Rust;"Once upon a time in Rust, in less cringy format, recollected to the best of my memory.Together with the help of a random friend, I made a small, simple base and proceeded to work on gathering resources for I'd say about 20 hours, upgrading said base along the way as it was my intent to turn it into a farm.I was getting harrassed by a small group of people every now and then but they didn't seem really interested in raiding, just camping or taking whatever kits they could get from our exchanges.After a small conversation in outpost, I realized something very important about landmines, something that seemed very unused at the time.Out of spite from the exchanges that got nowhere, I decided to put all my efforts into crafting possibly over a hundred landmines, surrounding the area around the base with them. There were many bushes and grass around the area, making it easy to hide those mines.After that, I started armoring the base, changing specific stone walls to metal walls, and more important (and some fake) walls with high qual.A couple of hours later when working on furnaces I started hearing the sound of certain landmines popping, often chain detonating as one detonated the other. A couple more exchanges later and some kits I took and another group of people got entangled into the mess, a larger clan, which also ended up getting killed by the landmines, several times. The explosions and constant fights however, seemingly attracted more and more people, nakeds, smaller groups, duos and people trying to cash in by getting kills and kits from others.I had upgraded what I could, with whatever resources I had left. Occasionally using what kits I could salvage to do a little bit more shooting, but most of the time as a solo you're not getting anywhere when there's such a large amount of players expecting you. Wipe was almost at hand, so I didn't really mind.The honeycombed walls didn't last long, and it certainly wasn't longer until they got through to where they wanted. But even then, people still kept dying to more landmines. I had honestly lost count of how many I had placed around, of how many resources were used. But boy did I have a smile on my face, knowing that as soon as they got into the TC, there was really nothing I had in terms of resources other than a couple stacks of high qual and metal scrap. And I'm more than sure that the amount of gear lost to the landmines, as they  in one's inventory if they die to one, was not worth what was found there.TL;DR I used every single resource gathered over a wipe to make a large amount of people most likely lose an enormous quantity of their work and resources for almost nothing.11/10 would do it again.Thank you, Rust."

252490;Rust;"After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote ""Sorry guys :D"" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be ""shoot-on-sight?"" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience."

252490;Rust;good game but it's filled with the worst people spawned on this earth who have never had a fatherly figure and/or will never find a partner because they door camp them irl and get arrested for it.

252490;Rust;Do you ever feel useless, like you don't matter? Do you feel like anything you accomplish is pointless and leads to nothing? Well congratulations you found the perfect game for yourself. Spawn on the beaches of Normandy and get gunned down instantly. Maybe spawn in a desert and get bashed in the head by a hamburger rock. Perhaps spawn in the North Pole and get eaten by a fatass polar bear. When you eventually pick a nice spot to start building your paranoid schizophrenic honeycomb house made out of the finest wood, make your way to the open roads so you can destroy some barrels and get some silly little scrap and some low grade fuel. Maybe even pick up the green card at the gas station as well. That's the only time you are progressing in this game, any other time you are either killed and called racist slurs or have your entire house leveled by mystical little rocket fairies that take your things. This game has made me and my whole friend group spend countless hours to mauled in the very end to the point of blind rage. I have pooped blood because of the  sheer speed of the stool coming out of my buttcheeks because I am so infuriated. The graphics are great if you want your PC to explode in your face causing third degree burns. The animations are also nice if you are into games that makes your character look like they have lost control of basic motor skills. You cant even change your characters appearance so I look as disappointing in game (maybe more) as I do in real life. That being said if you want to attempt to feel unforeseeable rage I highly recommend this game.
252490;Rust;"Before buying Rust, ask yourself the following questions.1. Do you have a full time job?2. Do you want a game that is not toxic?3. Do you want a game that gives you a fair chance, regardless of group size?If you answered ""yes"" to any of these questions, do not buy this game.You will spend 25 hours a day playing rust in order to stay relevant on the server you are playing on. Also if you're not on for these 25 hours a day you will be offline raided and lose everything. So if you're looking for a new, full-time, toxic job then this game is for you! For the low price of only $40 you too can be employed.(Though while I did make this game my full time job I did enjoy it which is why I left a positive review.)"
252490;Rust;The key to enjoying RUST is simple... Find the right server. If you like desperately trying to avoid getting ghosted by groups of geared player-killers while clawing your way into position as top dog, there's a server for that. If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areas, there's a server for that. If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlined, there's a server for that. The graphics are intense and visceral, yet also beautiful, while the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system. For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to things, otherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooter.

252490;Rust;Do you like putting in hours of work just to be offline raided by a group of 15?

252490;Rust;Everyone starts out naked in the world. You own nothing. You don't know what the world around you is like since it's all created from randomnessYou struggle to survive and gain a footholdPeople work hard to get resources for themselves  People specialize in the skills they are good at  People trade with one another  People form tribes and make alliancesGroups experience social friction and form rivalries  Those who trust too easily experience betrayal  The strong take from the weak and become stronger Eventually you end up in a society run by lying, genocidal, sociopaths   That's my description of what real life is like. It's very similar to the game Rust.
252490;Rust;So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here.- Great concept.- Stunning graphics- Game mechanics are great- The combat system is good- The crafting system is very good- Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding- Skins.- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it
252490;Rust;The description Steam gives of Rust on this page is misleading. It is a survival game only in the sense that other players will kill you. They will kill you for any reason, and probably call you a ni**er too. You will rage quit. You will wonder why you even bought the game. But it keeps drawing you back. How can i make my base more secure? How can i protect all my loot that i worked for hours or days to collect? You will turn the game on only to find you've been killed and everything you have is gone. You start yet again on the beach with nothing but a rock. This isn't a game, its an anxiety and anger inducer filled with racists and masochists playing out their fantasies.This game brings out the absolute worst of the human spirit. You will either love this game or hate it. There is no in between. Don't let well produced youtube videos mislead you on what to expect out of this game. This isn't a pick up and play game, you need to consistently sink time in to get anywhere. Before work, after work, before you go to sleep, hell, even set an alarm in the middle of the night if you have to (it wont matter, your base got raided, ni**er). 10/10 this is the worst best game I've ever played.

252490;Rust;You have to play this game 24/7, so get ready to lose everything in your life, except for the virginity.
252490;Rust;In the first 2h of playing the game I got yelled at by a 7 year old russian, got called the n word and got chased down by a 10 man group. 10/10 would recommend
252490;Rust;walked outside to hear an angry Russian naked chasing another naked with a rock 10/10

252490;Rust;"I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much. All I have is a rock.. I'm scared.There seems to be no sign of other humans. I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now...Tonight I feast.Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a ""Steam"", ahh, the good ol' days.I will be home soon. I promise.I'm sorry.I have killed a man.It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort.And all of his gear, it was... Enticing.He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed.All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family...But tonight I feast.I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area.The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers.I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.. In poverty.I think I'll live.Just for a while longer.I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that.I still am in a way.I don't know what to do.The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck..My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal.Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven.I am bleeding out. I am in god's hands now.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"

252490;Rust;In the end, you always come back to the rock and torch. The game is a great experience and highly addicting :D 10/10
252490;Rust;I don't see any problems in this game. Sure, there is the occasional racism, homophobia, psychopaths, cheaters (A lot), toxic zergs, toxic 13 year old children, racist 13 year old children, racists zergs, the common “♥♥♥” kids, overall depression, and more racism. So overall a pretty good game for all ages.
252490;Rust;"Rust isn't about building a pretty fort with your friends, logging out and then coming back tomorrow to pick up where you left off. No, Rust is about psychology. I have watched a bunch of naked men with rocks rove the hillside in search of the ""clothed"" and kill mercilessly. I have watched people come together over d*ck paintings they created together. Sometimes you will join a server and there is a small group that take everything and leave nothing. You might even be taken prisoner or trapped and then taunted until eventually it is too much and you give up on life. Much like real life there are good people and bad people. If you take games too seriously, you won't enjoy this. This is survival of the numbers and occasionally survival of the most clever. Never give up, never give in, it all starts with a rock."
252490;Rust;Do you want to spend hours of your life running around performing mundane tasks just to lose it all in .8 seconds when a CHAD with a full metal AK set kills you and takes your bow? If so, then this is the game for you!
252490;Rust;"_______________________________This game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place._______________________________At the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't.For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.This resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart._______________________________When you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to ""Legacy"" being the best state of the game, I disagree.The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.These are named: .Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier. - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped.______________________________________________________________Well, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones._______________________________If you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game._______________________________I'm working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts. I'm just giving you my two cents about the game."

252490;Rust;I woke up in the grass, my head hurting and my body cold. I was naked.I ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. We greeted each other, and agreed to work together.After a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.One day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.I looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. The next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.Later that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.It was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.The next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.I was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.They said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. Then the war began.They got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.Luckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.After a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.My friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.They eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. It was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.To this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?I'm surviving.Stories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.9/10
252490;Rust;good game makes u racist tho
252490;Rust;best worst game
252490;Rust;Feels like working a full time job with the only payment being increased anger issues, love it!
252490;Rust;10/10.got jailed for an hour and forced to look at a painting of garfield under fear of death.
252490;Rust;Beat up 3 kids that were screaming at me with a rock in the first minute of my gameplay, love the game
252490;Rust;This game will cause you depression and remove your social life
252490;Rust;You'll get your best experience during your first days of playing - a romantic novice with a naive belief that you can do whatever you want on that wonderful dangerous island spending hours for mining, planning & constructing buildings of your dreams... And then it starts...With every new death and robbed shelter your mind accumulates anger at all that.You study yourself, read guides, watch videos, become aggressive and evil.After weeks of successful and unsuccessful acts of vengeance you'll understand that this game forced to be played one way: creating top equipment, maximum protection of your shelter, raiding everything that stands and destroying everything that moves.Congratulations! You've started living a revenge in an environment where ceasing to create violence means to perish by yourself. Worth trying but promise yourself to stop one day!
252490;Rust;So glad I paid $40 to get called the N word and shot by my own friends. very nice.
252490;Rust;Talked to a guy who sounded Russian about the meaning of life. He then killed me with his rock.I like this game
252490;Rust;Will probably lead to a premature death caused by heart failure after making a play. Would definitely recommend!
252490;Rust;"I met a man who helped me with my adventures. Here is my story.- I met a man who helped me when I started my adventures in this beautiful island. He helped me out since I was a newbie, he fed me chicken that came from a cow, sheltered me in a wooden house that I couldn't escape from and he protected me from the wolves I tried to pet. Once I finally understood the game, he released me into the wild, I took a few steps into the open and BOOM I got shot in the back by him. I respawned at camp and beat him up with a rock, took his stuff and ran off happily ever after.10/10 MUST BUYEDIT: The man has captured me once again, but this time, my knowledge has advanced. I entered his fortress willingly, but little did he know, I was an evil mastermind. He took me as one of his ""crew members"". Along with 2 other people, we journeyed and raided other buildings. But slowly I stole gear from their base and soon, equipped with full kevlar and a bolt action rifle, destroyed their sleeping bags and once again killed them all. I ran away while holding the V key (in game chat) and played the TROLOLOLOL song. I ran off into the sun set and went offline to write this update."

252490;Rust;It's one of those games that you start hating but you keep coming back to it.
252490;Rust;I'm a 46 year old dad and I absolutely love playing this with my 13 year old son. Don't get caught up over losing loot to a bunch of zergs, it's just part of the game. Let your kid set the destination, or decide to attack a base, or a ship and just have fun being naked survivalists for an evening. I take the role of a base builder and keep us on our feet, he likes shooting weapons and is an excellent shot.An awesome game to bond over, and a great way to talk about how to not be a jerk online, how to deal with disappointment, how to work as a team when you make alliances, and how to be a gracious winner. He loves to help new players, will upend a planned evening to help some newbie with starting gear. Great game to play with your kids.
252490;Rust;Chased a guy with a rock, with a rock, around a rock. Game Rocks.
252490;Rust;: (aka big groups) can stomp all over you because of sheer number advantage and the rate they can progress through the wipe. Zergs are especially powerful after they implemented the group update where you can see your teammates blips which means you dont have to call for a jump check anymore.: Very, very, very, few people you meet will be friendly. Normally, anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn.: Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.: You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible, hJune shows us that, (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go.: The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day, everyday, for the entire wipe, will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play, I wouldn't play at all.: With any game, there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun, your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted, but I find this funny.: Mostly on offical servers, so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers.: Once you learn the ropes, it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights.

252490;Rust;Very nice and tasty game but the community more toxic than chernobyl.
252490;Rust;This game is the reason why i have trust issues.
252490;Rust;The game is so sweaty and try hard that you start to ponder about what the other players are doing in their life. Are they working? Is Rust their full time job? You start to think that these people probably never touch grass for consecutive days. Finally, you start realising, you are also on the same boat as them. You try to be better than them at not touching grass, sacrificing your sleep just so you can get an edge over them. BECAUSE you are as addicted to the game as they are. Addiction is real, buy this game at your own risk.

252490;Rust;"Rust, Rust, Rust, where do I begin. Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.Well, first off, Rust is a game of ""Survival"". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a ""raid-proof"" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.Rust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.I would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:- Play ""Native American"" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold. - Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.- Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed. Good luck and happy hunting"
252490;Rust;Spawn as a black naked, get called the N-Word by various different white twelve year olds, farm for 30 minutes to get killed to someone who has an eoka screaming at you. Build a base, get raided by a Chinese zerg. To succeed in rust you must have no job, no friends outside of the game, and no brain cells. All in all a game that makes me want to neck myself, but its still fun sometimes.
252490;Rust;"This was easily one of the most fun games I had in my entire library! Building and raiding bases, trolling nakeds and getting trolled by nakeds... complete with one of the most toxic player base I've played with and against.... would definitely recommend!! But then 11 days after investigating reported hackers on my community server (Grimlock Gaming), Steam notified me that I was banned from Rust. As per EAC's totally 100% accurate system, I was using ""3rd Party Software"" (on my own community server - a server where I'm the admin... and owner... which btw already contained all the admin tools I needed to assist in identifying hackers). I appealed () but was told that they (EAC) are totally 100% accurate, I was a bad boy and the ban will not be lifted. I contacted them again but received no response. I contacted Facepunch  and was told that they totally trust EAC's totally 100% accurate system and to get lost. I have sent EAC numerous emails, logged a number of tickets... and even created a Reddit post (which the admin quickly deleted) and they still refuse to investigate my case. It's now 240+ days since my ban and I've officially given up! I've lost quite a few bucks on this game; skins, 3 (or more) gifts, two community servers... I cannot recommend a game where the devs offer no support whatsoever. Lesson learned!!"
252490;Rust;Walked outside my house and immediately got shot at.Decided to go back inside and play rust instead.
252490;Rust;i hate this game but its the best game i have ever played
252490;Rust;Spawned in, saw a naked guy running around with a rock saying the n word. Good game 100% recommended!

I put ""DayZ"" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing. 60/100"
252490;Rust;"Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious, you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources—the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the ♥♥♥♥-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn't laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, ""Hey man, wait a second!"" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement."
252490;Rust;Great game but new players should play on modded servers with low population, community / vanilla high pop are almost impossible for a new player to get a proper start on.
252490;Rust;I hate this game.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Legendary game... Genre maker... Our childhood game... You have the source code for a long time... Make the HoMM title great again.---  yoruma destek verin de tam versiyonun hd'si bir çıksın artık, HoMM 3 candır, efsanedir ---* means more QoL changes (transfer all, train all, detailed town list, heroes list, etc), hotkey customizations...As I also stated in discussion panel,Considering that this game is a classic, a masterpiece of TBS genre, and an element of prestige. It shouldn't be this hard to make an updated full version remaster while the source codes are found. Moreover, it will continue to be sold for years to new generations, as long as there is multiplayer support (Single is good enough, but HoMM 3 multiplayer something like chess...). Because it still has no rivals in its genre.Even today this version has 1000-2000 online players on Steam, without any updates or exp. for years. And if you add the GoG, Ubisoft, and hd mod versions on it, we can easily think that the game has 5-10K players that play daily. Well, think the potential of an updated full version of it...It's really surprising that the game hasn't been revived even though it's #1 on the GoG bestseller (Among 4264 games, and most of them are old but gold ones, so that'a huge success).It's a real goldmine if they're going to take it up again. Even with a good team leader, they could keep the spirit of the game and make a very good upgrade instead of just upscaling to HD.**Something like ""HoMM 3 Reunified"" not just ""HoMM 3 HD""... Just like Diablo 2 Resurrected not only better graphics, but deeper touchs. And again, Of course with taking the community's opinions for not to lose spirit...You can also add your ideas about updated HoMM 3 complete HD, in the comments section below. What should be, what should be added, what should be improved in a possible HoMM 3 Complete HD version?"
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Of course after examining this game from head-to-toe, I belong to a wide-spread group of disappointed Heroes 3 fans. This game lacks the expansions and content that initially made Heroes 3 what it is today. Any version of Heroes 3 without the complete experience is not a complete game and veteran fans of the Might and Magic franchise deserve more than this.Some of us still bought the game knowing what it lacked to support the company in hopes that it would continue to provide content and general maintenance. When news of a Steam release for Heroes of Might and Magic 3 reached our ears, a lot of us had expected that content would be added after time.To our disappointment, further development to the 1/3rd of a game we were given stopped shortly after it's release. A majority who experienced this disappointment turned to GoG and purchased the Complete edition that they offered. Though GoG lacks an HD integration with their copy, fans eager to have the more complete game in their possession would make that small sacrifice for the sake of functionality and completeness.Most veteran fans and tech-savvy Heroes 3 owners will grab that copy and install the HoMM3 HD mod by Alexander Barinov to, more or less, recreate the Heroes 3- HD Edition experience with GoG's Complete edition. This, of course, nearly takes away from the point of attaining or playing Ubisoft's Steam release.For new fans looking to purchase or have already purchased this game, once they learn about the large amount of missing content in this Steam release, they often become discouraged to continue playing.The only thing that can save this HD Steam release is adding the expansions in one way or another. The game is in danger of becoming Steam abandonware. Successful games keep up with maintenance and add content. I would revise this review completely if they could tackle that main issue.So if you're new or a veteran fan of Heroes 3, I'd highly recommend you to wait for the Complete HD game or go check out GoG's release with the HD Mod.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Get the GoG version instead. Contains all the campaigns as well as various updates and mod availability.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;GO BUY ON GOG!Im giving a positive review because this game is amazing and always will be. But do yourself a favor and get it on good old games. It has the complete version with all the dlc for basically the same price. And if you think the dlc isn't that big of a deal then you never played without it and don't realize what your saying.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Heroes 3 is my favourite game, but please dont buy this unfinished cash-grab.This version only has the base game (restoration of erathia) included and NONE of the official expansions.When playing multiplayer you cannot spectate your friends turn or his fights like the classic hotseat. You have to stare at the map (cant interact with own units or towns) while you wait for the 10 minute turn to end.Can strongly recommend to buy the GOG complete version, install HD+ patch and HOTA patch. That way you have decent graphics, 2 factions more, can play the expansion maps and all of its benefits.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;As much as I love the game - I cannot recommend this edition. It is based on the very early release of the base game in 1999 (without massive add-ons Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death). A lot of features are missing and controls feel clumsy comparing to Shadow of Death.On the positive note - they've added high resolution support, which is OK. But free fan-made  did it better.Do yourself a favour - go buy a good old HoMM 3 Complete Edition on any other platform, and install . It adds modern resolutions support, some nifty control features and ...drum roll... freaking ONLINE lobby to the 20 years old game!!!How come a group of enthusiasts made a better edition than Ubisoft - is a mystery to me, but here we are.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Ubisoft, the only reason why they're not the worse company in America (EA Games) is because: they're not based out of America. Here's the Pros and Cons of this ""new and improved version of Heroes III""Pros:- ""HD""- It's Heroes IIIWell that was easy.Cons:- ""HD"" only improves pixel quality, with no improvements to compatibility to its framerates it may look ""nice"" at a standstill but who cares about motionless, sub-par ""HD""- No Random Map Generator that Heroes III Complete has.- No Conflux Race that Heroes III Complete has.- More expensive than Heroes III Complete, and it doesn't even have Random Map Generator nor Conflux Race among Other things. (The 2 expansions)- Buggier. Who the hell remakes a game only to make it buggier? Seriously. WTF.- Crashes more often. Same as above.- No Random Map Generator. That's a big deal you know. Those who havn't had it just don't know how much they're missing.Ultimately, would I play Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition? Nope. Waste of Money. Heroes of Might & Magic III Complete is 9/10 times better. I at least hoped they would have made the HD versions online playability better but.... Thanks Ubisoft, I don't know what I was expecting. Obviously something better than this piece of crap.Let me say this again. Ubisoft is charging you MORE for this ""HD"" version that is missing not one, but TWO expansions. It is BUGGIER, crashes MORE frequently, and again, they had the GALL to charge  more for it. I've been disapointed before; but, this takes the cake."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Do not buy this version. I'll let everyone make their own assumptions after this short review without pointing fingers to who does what (hint/hint).I instantly got interested in this version hoping that somewhat refreshed visuals might make an old gem look more visually polished. I was wrong. The difference is almost unnoticable and due to the downside of having only Restoration of Erathia instead of full package of 2 expansions with additional castle, items and limitless map generator, this purchase is not worth even 1/3rd of the price of full game on good old games site -  which costs twice less by default.DO not buy Steam version. Save Your money and conscience, get GOG version. A few pixels more, no achievements, but whole package.As this is only 3rd of the full game which has nothing new in that third, it cannot have score of more than just a 3rd of a game.  3/10
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Do not buy this version of the game if you want all the factions (conflux) and a random map editior or even the basic maps. These guys are basically scamming you by offering a subpar version of the game for a very high amount of moneys.Shame on you ubisoft you peasents.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;TOTAL SH*T No expansions, changed machanics (for worse), simpler textures than in original and no random map generator. Ubisoft as usual is trying to earn money for doing half the work. Buy Original version on GOG (already with all expansions) and instal hd mod for free. Better graphic, hd for free and unchanged, good (not the bullsh&t made in 1 hour from this remaster) mechanics. Ubisoft is a ♥♥♥#%*g greedy joke that disrespects gamers.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;DON'T BUY~5$ cheaper at GOG and you can get a free HD patch through a quick google search~Very buggy~Multiplayer is buggy and not worth buying this product~Also the 5$ cheaper version is the FULL game with all expansions, this is the vanilla game with NO EXPANSIONSIn short its a worse product, it MIGHT get patched later but honestly this feels like a pump and dump for some quick cash, dont expect it to get patched later
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;No random map with choice for number of human and CPU players.  Just buy the original on GOG that actually has all important functionality.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;ALL DLC'S should be made as well. We need more. Not necessary to be HD but at least the original should be available.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"NOT RECOMMENDED. This game is an awful tease - I'd bought it on pure nostalgia value, but at the end of the day I felt pretty crushed when I found that there are no expansions included, nor will there ever be. Essentially, Ubisoft couldn't get the source code for the expansion packs (disappointing) and declared that programming them again from scratch would be too much effort (understandable). The dealbreaker for me is that the complete edition with all expansions is available very cheaply on Good Old Games - there's no reason to buy this when the old version is cheaper and gives you more content. For what it's worth, the ""HD"" update is exactly what it says on the tin but it's not what you're hoping for. Pretty much all the sprites used to create the game were re-traced and more detail was added. I respect the work that must have taken, but at the end of the day it still looks like the game from the nineties that it is. You wanted the gameplay - the exact graphics are more-or-less irrelevant to me."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;First of all: this game is GREAT, you MUST play it.The review is not about the game itself, it's about this mediocre release. It lacks random map generator, expansions and a decent online system. There's another edition on GoG which has all the expansions, all you need to do is dowload the unofficial HD mod, which also includes the online lobby.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;useless , there is no  DLC , not even Conflux castle, no random map  . just buy the gog complete edition .then install ERA mod + HD mod and  enjoy  the best experience of your life .
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Let me start this review by saying, even though I do not recommend this on Steam, this is a great game. I do recommend this game to whoever will listen, but Steam faces one problem. As others have stated in their reviews, GOG offers the full game, including the expansions and its features, just not in HD. And last I checked, it was cheap too.Now you might ask: ""But what about HD?"" If you are someone asking this, someone who really cares about how it looks, just stop reading here. Dont buy this game. Even 4k wouldnt do much for this game.This just isnt a game you play for the graphics. It looks dated even in HD. You play HoMM3 for the gameplay. Even in 2020 this is still an amazing turn based strategy game. It has story, fantasy, castles, knights and dragons all working together (or against eachother). The UI works well and the game runs stable, even on modern systems.I love this game. I started playing it way back as a kid, when we rented it from the local library 20 odd years ago. I still play it now, although I usually play my GOG version. I love it so much, I started playing it again on steam just to get the achievements. But being honest, I just cannot recommend you buying it on steam. As great as the game is, its just not complete on steam.EDIT: Slight update and a few spelling errors.Since the initial review, I have played through most of the campaign and logged quite a few more hours. HoMM3 is every bit as much fun as I remember. It runs quite well on steam and occasionally, its actually noticeable that its the HD.However, this extra playtime does not sway my initial opinion. I still recommend getting this game on GOG. The minute improvement on graphics is just not enough. And the HD port brings a few, albeit minor, issues with it in the campaign. Certain campaign triggers do not work, so you cannot always explore the entire map, or gather all artifacts on the map. These are minor issues and you can finish the map just fine for the campaign, but for someone who knew how it was supposed to work, it was a slight letdown.Its still a great game though, and at the time of writing, I have already logged over 20 hours. If I had to choose between a movie ticket or this game on Steam, I'd pick the game. Regardless of the movie. It's just a shame the game is not complete on steam."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;It's a classic game we're talking about here, and the HD Edition doesn't really improve anything other than the superficial graphics. What it detracts, however, is surprising. Several types of enemies are missing. Once a creature is upgraded you can only get the upgrade, not the standard if you're low on gold. Random Map Generator is missing. Expansions are missing. And thus, version number does not match the map-packs that are available. Thousands of maps you can't play there.So. GOG has the complete Homm3 for a lower price than this. There is a mod/launcher that can run the old Homm3 on a modern PC in any resolution. And all of the minuses of the HD Edition do not exist in this case. Honestly, go for the old one, nevermind the minor splashes of paint to the HD Edition. It's just not worth it. It simplifies too much.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Where are DLC's ????????????? #sadface
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;The original version of Heroes of Might and Magic III is one of my favourite games, but this version is lacking one important feature, the one that made HOMMIII stand out against all others. Random maps. This HD Edition only allows you to play through scenarios, and battle against friends. For me, this game is utterly and completely ruined without randomized maps where you could test your strength against AI. Do yourself a favour, and find the original version instead of this one.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I love the game but they need to add the expansions for me to recommend it.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Do not buy this as HD edition. The graphic is awesome, but it does not contain any expansions. Just go to GOG, and you will find complete edition for 9.99, which is even better price than this, and you can download the HD patch. Still not as good as this HD edition graphic, but better play that with expansions. ONLY IF UBISOFT REMAKE THIS AS COMPLETE EDITION
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;THIS DOESNT HAVE MULTIPLAYER!. Google Heroes 3 HOTA, and you will see the multiplayer add on cant be installed on this ubisoft ♥♥♥♥. Better buy the premium edition on GOG and enjoy premium dlcs and an ability to play online(you could even download a HD mod). Upvote this so others wont be tricked into buying this crap!
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Heroes 3 is a really, incredibly good turn-based strategy game and a classic of the genre. The problem with this release is that it doesn't include the two expansion packs, so there's really no reason to buy it over the GOG release of the same game, which does include those. Without such things as the random map generator, this game loses a lot of its appeal.Go to GOG and buy the Complete Edition, and run it with HOMM3HD (easily Googled up)! Then get to enjoying one of the best turn-based strategies out there.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"I am old. My first PC game purchase ever was Heroes of Might and Magic III. A Windows 95 CD-Rom with an instruction book on real paper and my PC was not even met the requirements. It was an amazing experience. Little figures on a map searching for treasures and fighting monsters was something I only knew from table top games and now happened live on my 14"" CRT screen.A whole world opened for me and since then I was really addicted to the Fantasy Turn Based Strategy genre.Later played the Warlords series, the Age of Wonders series and the Disciples series.Almost 20 years later I still have Homm3 installed on my PC and now and then I even met people with the same experience from this game and we play hotseat together a whole night.I still own the original homm3 box, the Shadows of Magic boxed edition, the Collector's edition and the GOG version and when I don't have one available when I'm somewhere else I pirate it for a moment. I guess that's legal because I own the game in four different versions.All this years so many progress is made by the real fans of this series to make the 20 year old title even better. We have VCMI, HD mod, Hota and so much user created content now that it is almost impossible to make a new edtion better then what is available fromt the community.Maybe the biggest reason for me to play this game all this years without getting bored is that every map I play is different and unpredictable. This is because a generator creating a different map every play. IMO a must for every strategy/RPG/Adventure game on the market. I do not like scripted games, predictable games or story campaigns so much because after playing it one time I lost my interest to play the same map again. Also it keeps multiplayer fair because this way the map cannot be learned by players so nobody have advantage of knowing a map better then you.Now imagine the best book you ever read and imagine a cheap B movie producer turns your book into a bad movie. That is exactly what happened with this version of Homm3 for me. The menu's of the game did not have any overhaul and are not fit in my laptop screen resolution anymore while the original 20 year old game does. For every click I make in the menu I have to wait at least two seconds while in the original game I misclick because the interface is so fast.I don't see any progress in interface or menu artwork and it's so much slower then the original. I don't understand this.All content after the original game came out like the expansions, the user created content, the new factions, the thousands of maps/campaigns and even the RMG (random map generator) is not there. It's just the base game and even the base game on GOG have more content because it's at least updated with bugfixes afterwards.The unique selling point from Dotemu is the graphics overhaul and Í have to admit that it is very nice to see that someone spend so many hours creating better looking monsters and heroes for my favorite game of all time.The units are cleaner and less pixelated on higher resolutions now and that is not bad. But they do not try something original or different so it's not amazing or surprisingly good. Just ok. In the town screens and on the map I cannot see any difference with the original and because every click is so much slower then the original game for me it's not worth the graphic overhaul.I bought the game just to support the graphic artist and to have a voice on Steam to write my review.I don't like the remake of my favorite game is not the perfect remake I can imagine. A remake IMO can never be a downgrade of the original. If you don't have original code from expansions you have to wait more time to release while hiring people from the community to make the perfect game or just don't touch it.It looks like a quick project to make cashflow for the company instead of a soul project led by people dedicated to the Homm series. That's something bad."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"""IT'S A TRAP!""This game looks a little prettier, but only contains the base game, not the two expansions. This means it's missing 13 campaigns, an ENTIRE FACTION, the random map generator, and miscellaneous other features, such as a campaign editor, Combination Artifacts (where if you can assemble a particular combination of artifacts you get a bonus, powerful artifact) and sundry others.Do yourself a favor, head over to GOG and buy the Heroes III Complete Edition. Honestly, the original sprite graphics still hold up rather well, and you'll get so much more value for your money."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Ubisoft has started REMOVING single player games (yes, base games, not just online DLC) that customers BOUGHT, from their library. If you are thinking about buying this game (and ""BUY"" is the plain wording on every Steam store page), be aware you may only be able to play it for the next 6 weeks, before Ubisoft REMOVES it from your library.Ubisoft also thinks it is clever to put the game on promotion for new suckers just before REMOVING the game.  Ie AC Liberation HD was on promotion price last week during the Steam summer sale, this week the store page says the game will no longer playable in 6 weeks time.  The Steam store pages (links below) for AC Liberation HD, and Silent Hunter 5, both have notices saying ""Please note this title will not be ACCESSIBLE following September 1st, 2022"".  Even though you BOUGHT these single player games, you will not be able to access them.I am setting my review on every Ubisoft game I own to negative.  If you think this practice is unacceptable, please comment, upvote the review, or leave your own review."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;i recommend this game but not from steam..  it doesnt support the expansionsinsteadbuy the complete edition from gog, download the hd mod for the best expirence
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"The game itself is a timeless classic and deserves a million thumbs up. But as of NOW, and for THIS edition of the game..Conflux, powerful combo artifacts, new map locations, and the random map generator will be missed, but the prospect of a smooth(?) multiplayer environment, where you won't have to experience ""can't connect, timed out"" to a computer 5 metres away meaning you don't spend 30 minutes just trying to get everyone into the lobby and God forbid anyone disconnects during the 4 hour session... Worth. Or so I thought....We're missing LAN - the only reason I (and probably you too, if you ever buy this) got this edition is because windows no longer supports IPX and all the problems that came with trying to start a session on TCP/IP. But no UDP? Not a gameplay issue and we are expected to play via steam, but still..Also, multiplayer got a new problem. There is this previously unheard of 5~10 sec 'loading' period at the end of EVERY HUMAN PLAYER'S TURN, where all animations freeze and you can't do anything, kinda like the little unskippable tune you had to hear at the beginning of every turn during hot seat, just more insane with no workarounds (and that tune served a purpose, like kicking your friend out of the room before he spied on you - this doesn't) - I have no idea what the game is doing while it throws me an hourglass but it wasn't and shouldn't be there. Most of us do indeed alt+tab during opponent's turns, but early game this practically doubles turn cycles.Please tell me they're patching the hourglass thing. Or I might go back to giving it fifty tries to play the game the old way."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Go buy the completed edition on GOG. This version only has the base game with a bit enhanced graphic. Not worth buying.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Would be great if the random map function could be added.  Playing this version with friends and we are running out of maps. I think I speak for the whole community when i say add the Armageddon´s blade and Shadow of death to the steam version.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I refunded this game. Buying the complete edition and installing a HD mod is a much better deal. The game is fine and it works as advertised, but it does not include any DLC or expansion packs that are included in the complete edition.I repeat myself, this game is great, it always has been and the HD edition is just as good. But I cannot recommend it over buying the complete edition and installing a free HD mod.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Do not purchase this game on steam.  Purchase the ""complete edition"" on GOG. This is a completely barebone experience with none of the dlc included. - Half the maps and campaigns are missing- No random map generator (essential imo)- No conflux town- Missing tons of quality of life improvements. Once you know these differences; HD edition is frankly unplayable.- No good mod/map support because they are all made for the complete edition. The main mod everyone should download is the heroes HD mod. (Adds amazing qol improvments.) Not to be confused with HD edition. Goated game tho"
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Doesn't have the DLCs, which allow you to play with randomly generated maps, just buy complete edition instead (in GOG, for example).
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Great game but WHERE is the random map generator it used to have in the original version??? It's what made the game a hit for me. Bring it back PLEASE!!!
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;My grandmother used to play this game all the time and I would sit next to her when I was young, while she would explain that she loves the Angels and they are the strongest in the game. Everytime I play this game it reminds me of her. I love it
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;go buy the one on GoG, in addition to mods and dlc (yes this seriously doesnt include dlc that came out over 20 years ago, they're that lazy), you get to tell ubisoft where to stick their lazy upscaled garbage
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Listen, I know how convenient it is to just download off steam and play, but I PROMISE, there is no other way to play this game, than with the HD mod and Horn of the Abyss. Just buy it off GoG and install those two things. It'll be cheaper, and higher quality. Trust me.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;It's missing half the game. They even removed the random map generator....
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;It's a 1999 experience with better graphics. No DLCs, no QoL, no mod support besides one mod on Steam. Save your money, buy Complete Edition from GoG and mod it however you want.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Lots of features has been cut, no custom maps, strange behaviour of some spells (e.g. town portal). This app is just a shadow of great game, earning money on big name instead of good content
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;!! READ ME !! This is a great game. great and immersive gameplay.But to anyone wanting to buy this game, beware!It is not the collectors edition, which means: - It is missing a lot of content like maps, castles, scenarios, creatures, you name it.- FPS is capped at 30.- No random maps.I higly suggest buying it at  for the complete version. It is more stable and multiplayer is not laggy
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Not worth it. I bought it only for multiplayer online feature. But instead: 1. Go to . and buy and install complete edition. 2. Go to  and install and registrer. 3. Make your friend do the same and go play some heroes 3 game with the expansion packs. No error, no hustle, way more creatures and maps to play.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;This isn't the full Heroes 3 game it is only the original WITHOUT expansions!! do not buy it!! Instead get the complete GOG version and install an HD mod. I truly regret having not refunded this in time.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Before I go off on one, I want to stress, this is one of the greatest games in the genre ever created. This /version/ of this game, however, is such a massive step back that it is genuinely upsetting that thousands of people have this as their only Heroes of Might and Magic 3 experience.One of the greatest 90's games there ever was. A defining point of PC gaming. The game that converted me from a weird PS1 shooter fan to a hardcore RPG/Strategy fan.'Heroes of Might and Magic III - Complete' is one of the greatest games to ever be released on PC. With some of the best expansions to any game I have ever played, well worth the money even on release.HoMM3 HD Edition is terrible. Do not buy this. Ever. Take your money to GoG where the game is the same price but with DLC. Then get one of the free HD texture mods online and your version will play better, look better and include all the available content for the game.Do not support lazy devs. Their excuse was all the source files for the expansions were lost. Meanwhile, other companies are creating entirely new expansions from scratch for 20 year old strategy games..Once more do not buy this version. There is nothing in this that you cannot do by spending 2-3 minutes downloading 2 mods. This version of the game is massively inferior and lacking in content when compared to the extremely readily available Complete Edition elsewhere.I bought this version near release and barely played when I found out how poor this version really is. I thought, ""hey, every other dev bringing back old strategy and RPG games are putting a lot of effort in to bringing their games to the modern age, surely a game with such pedigree will one day receive the same attention and love""I was wrong. This version of this game is abandoned by its devs and has been left in a known broken and unfinished state. It is a massive step back compared to any other version of this game. My CD copy of complete, ripped to my old PC with a HD texture pack and running on my Android phone using VCMI plays and looks better than this version. please do not support these crooks."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;ADD DLC PLEASE I NEED FULL CONTENT
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Many years have passed since I played Heroes of Might and Magic for the first time. I still can EASILY RECOMMEND HEROES OF MIGHT AND MAGIC III COMPLETE but unfortunately I can't recommend the Heroes III HD because there are no expansions... It's just the overpriced and poorly remastered standard game and it's missing many contents for example:-no random map generator,-no campaign editor,-no conflux castle,-not so many scenarios,and much more...In the store there was written something about a ""new multiplayer lobby"". Yep, its possible to play online but you don't have the working lobby (atleast me and my friend couldn't get it to work). You just probably need the IP from the guy you want to play with. You can play online like this in standard non HD version too.10/10 for Original Heroes III,4/10 for HD remake of Heroes III...You should buy somewhere original Heroes III with all expansions for a cheap price instead of this one."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Heroes lll, is an amazing game. But this version is terrible. The graphics are great, and that's it! There are only about 25-40 scenarios, and half of the campaign is not in the game because the DLC's are missing. I don't recommend you to buy this game. Buy it on , cheaper and 100% better!
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Well, look at what we've got here... A scam.Heroes of Might & Magic III is a great game, it really is but the Steam version is just crap, it feels like a demo that you have to pay for, and an overpriced demo while at it.Go and buy it on GoG, you'll have:- Cheaper and better.- Restoration of Erathia, Armagedons blade, and Shadow of Death, Armagedon and Shadow of Death aren't on the Steam version.- Greater map pool.- Random Generated/Randomized maps.- More campaign options.- More items.- Conflux Town (faction which is not available on the Steam version).- More creatures.- HD mod is free (if you even care about that, I honestly do not).- Soundtrack comes with the game (that's a plus on GoG in general, you don't have to pay for the soundtrack you already have paid for like you do on Steam, which is utterly dumb and greedy.- Creature tables and guides.There is no reason to buy it on Steam.Plus the rest of the series is available on GoG, even the first one, but not on Steam.I would love if they were all on Steam and complete as the GoG edition but unfortunately it is not the case, I would buy them again if they were on Steam and complete, I do not know why I have bought this... I thought that I could somewhat merge the GoG version into the Steam one, or at least transform it into the GoG version using some parameters but no luck, it probably would be possible but it's too much time consuming so I gave up.That's my feedback about the Steam edition of Heroes of Might & Magic III - HD Edition.It literally deserves 0/10 because of the non competence and greediness from Ubisoft, it's not Steam/Valve fault after all.But if I were to talk about the GoG version.I'd say that it is simply an epic game.- Great textures/graphics for its time.- Lot of factions but it could uses more units in my opinion, especially the neutral ones.- Great and fun campaigns.- Almost infinite of replayability - Great soundtrack- Modding- Just go and play it already.9.5/10 for the GoG version.Do not encourage Ubisoft by buying this, even if you are a fan of the series, even if you don't care about playing your games or not, even if it is just for your collection, do NOT buy it, not even at 2$.I'll ask you this... Why playing a uncompleted version when you can play a complete version for cheaper?I'll let you think about it.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;this version is missing a lot of content
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Heroes of Might and Magic 3 is a great game, but this version was just a shameless cash grab that didn't include the expansions. Get the game on gog instead because this version is just plain awful.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;1) The game HEROES 3 is one of my favourite games of all time time.2) This VERSION is absolutely not the superior edition of the game.The GOG version is everything you could ask for. I actually bought the steam one too, as I planned to get all of the achievements. GOG Version - USUALLY MUCH CHEAPER+ New Town (Conflux) + All Campaigns + 3x Maps of Base Game + Random Map Generator + Free Soundtrack + Modding Capability Mods for GOG Feature -HD Rework + 1 New Town (Cove) + 1 Planned New Town (Factory) +New Items + New Creatures + New Maps (Including much larger maps) +Much, much more...Steam Version - Base Game + HD Rework + AchievementsYou decide (?)Having said all this, even with just the base game, I would recommend Heroes 3 to anyone. Try and play a small map on Hotseat with family or friends when you're altogether. I'd recommend leaving the room for opponents turns! Make sure you have another game in the next room to keep people busy (I recommend Smash Bros.)
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Heroes III is a great game and I would recommend it to absolutely everyone. Sadly, the HD edition available on Steam consists only of the ""Restoration of Erathia"", aka base game. For those who don't know, there are actually 2 more expansions called ""Armageddon's Blade"" and ""Shadow of Death"". Unfortunately, we cannot play them in the HD edition. This edition is a graphic remaster of RoE and does not include many adjustments, new units or maps that can be seen in the Complete Edition, which contains all three expansions. Is it worth buying then? Yes, absolutely yes. The graphic redesign is overwhelmingly well made. For those who played the original game, playing this game will feel like a return to home. Same game, same engine, same great story and heroes, but with much better, fresh & new graphics. Recently I've completed all of the campaigns that are available in this game and all I can say, is that it was a great journey. Playing this masterpiece is really relaxing and always drives me in the good mood. If you haven't played it yet or you're still thinking whether to buy it or not - don't waste more time and already jump in this beautiful world."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I have a billion hours on this game off of Steam. DO NOT buy the Steam version. It is the worst version I have ever played. I woldn't get it even if it was offered for free.  Do yourself a favour, save your money and buy the COMPLETE version from GOG like I did. Oh and don't forget to get the HOMM3 HD+ mod from the web and enjoy true HD quality. You are welcome!PS: For more details on why I rated it as I did, please click to view the comments of this review.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;HoMM 3 is One of THE best games ever made. But with expansions! This abomination of a lazy dev copy is just sad. Where are Armageddon's Blade and The Shadow of Death? Get the HoMM 3 Complete Edition on GoG instead!
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I have no idea how they managed to do it, but leave it to Ubisoft not only ruin a great franchise, but somehow, take a great game, make very minor changes and still somehow, make it terrible. The Fps is a bit off, it stutters, it's annoying, it's ugly. I can run Rome 2 total war a lot better than this game it seems. Unskippable Ubisoft logo at the intro, like they are proud of it somehow, though that can be modified out of the game by changing the files in the game folder.The music, instead of continuing where it left off like in the original, restarts now everytime the music changes. Walking in a grass field, cue the beginning of the grass theme, go to a city, cue the beginning of the appropriate city music. Needless to say it gets very very annoying to hear the same part of the same song every few minutes. Always the beginning of the song, always. You never spend that much time looking at your city, or walking your hero, so you never really hear the whole song, only the beginning. I get the idea that listening to a song from the middle can be a bad idea, but when the music is constantly changing, the old style fade in and fade out, and starting where you left off just worked so much better and just felt so much more right. Pressing space to visit the location you are standing on got dropped out as well. If you take a wrong portal, you are forced to spend movement going out of the portal and back in. Same if you happen to end your turn and the week on a mill. No idea why they thought that was an ability that had to be removed. I have heard rumors that cheats work in multiplayer, I haven't checked it myself, had trouble playing online. It's not working as well as I hoped. The achievements are, to put it lightly, uninspired. There are no fun achievements to chase, as in Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis. They are all like this: Beat this campaign, beat that campaign, beat this campaign. That's not really fun chasing those achievements, the campaigns may be fun to play, but the achievements are not even flavoring, they are just there so they could put ''Achievements'' in the description.  Was it absolutely impossible to have a achievement like ''Have every type of dragon in your army'' or ''Win a battle with only seven dwarfs''? Yes. Yes it was. That would have meant that they would actually had to put some work into the game.There... that's what's wrong with the base game. I know they didn't include the expansions, so i'm not complaining about that, since that was never advertised.In summary: It's lazy, it's buggy, it's bad. Ubisoft should just start working on games for tabloids and phones, because that is clearly what they want.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Just to clear things up before you start reading: I've played the original Heroes of Might and Magic 3 for over 2500 hours.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Wow. Just wow.It feels like Ubisoft loves to mess with their customers. Maybe that's the reason they keep doing it over and over again. Or are they just trying to beat EA for being the worst company in the gaming industry?! I guess we'll never know...- No random map generator. Long term motivation? NOPE! (Yes, I know that there is a map generator available, but it's not the randomized one I'm talking about.)- One fraction is missing.- No LAN support.- Both DLC's/Addons are missing.- [Bug] You have to click for every single moving point of your heroes. Having (e.g.) 100 moving points available will result in 100 clicks you have to make. - [Bug] Beside that, the map will reposition itself after every single step, so you have to ""re-aim"" 100 times as well - ON EVERY HERO, ON EVERY SINGLE DAY.- Considering the before mentioned things the price tag of 14,99 € feels like a huge smack in the face (I paid 9,99 € for HoMM3 Complete, including 2 discs).+ Overall better graphics, although the ""old"" version wasn't looking that bad tbh.+ Support for high resolutions.The only thing that would make this game more ridiculous would've been the integration of Ubisoft's beloved 30 FPS cap to make the game look more ""cinematic"".Conclusion: I was hoping to finally get my hands on a visually more appealing version of Heroes of Might and Magic 3. and I got f'ed hard. I really don't recommend anyone to buy this, unless Ubisofts comes up with some updates.Thanks, Ubisoft."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Gameplay is fun, nostalgia AF, but, there is no excuse for the developers and license holders of this 20 year old game to not release either expansion pack in the last five years.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Guys, Guys, Guys. Hold up before you buy this.First of all, I LOVE this series. I grew up with it as a child, and I distinctly remember playing both heroes of m&m and heroes chronicles which I got when I was 4.When I saw this in steam, my heart leapt with joy! Not only could I relive some joyful childhood memories, but others could as well. This product didn't cut it. Its not so much the random map generator. If this game was finished and you were really that concerned about this aspect, you could have hit up  for the full complete non hd version. That version still has a working map generator, and you could generate your maps, save them, and transfer them over to this game.You COULD possibly do this IF this game was FINISHED. Its not. Its missing both its add ons, which is a real dissapointment for me. It makes it so much less enjoyable; less enchanting than its original predecesor. It also makes it impossible to use the map generator or any maps you may have made as a kid using your original game copy (I have a original game of Heroes 3 on cd, and none of the maps I generate or make on that game copy work with this).While this game is hd, its not heroes 3. I recomend the following replacements:Heroes 3 complete edition: Located at . Just make an account and follow the steps, its not that hard. Comes with all add ons and random map gen.Also for the heck of it, Heroes Chronicles: mini game series based around heroes 3 which in my opinion gave a much more in dept storyline for people not invested in the history of heroes of might and magic to follow. Meaning, it starts you off with a charecter (Tarnum?), and you get to see his life play out from the beginning. Also located at . Only catch is that you may have to buy all of the games to get the full experience of Heroes 3 (landscape and castle/creature wise) and I dont currently know how much it costs.Sad that I have to give this a thumbs down but... well I cry because I care."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Let me be clear: NEGATIVE FOR THE RERELEASE, not of the game.This is only the base game, not Heroes Complete and there are no plans for the Expansions to be released. The game it self works just as well as it did in the past. Save your self $5 and buy the Complete version at GoG.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Don't buy it. No random map editor, ubisoft screwed up yet again. Just purchase the original Homm3 Complete from GOG
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I thought I wouldn't mind the lack of expansions too much, but there's just so much missing content. Plus, this edition introduced a couple of bugs that didn't exist before, like moats not doing damage.Just get the complete version from GoG instead, download the HD mod and Horn of the Abyss, and you've got the best possible H3 experience for less money than this.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;The game didn't receive the expansion packs
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;How in the nine blazing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hells do you figure selling a game that is as old as my childhood dreams being crushed, WITHOUT the full content (IE expansion packs), for THIS price is a good idea? Theres the corporate greed for ya. ♥♥♥♥ you Ubisoft.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Sadly I didn't read the reviews before buying - great game, but not worth 15€, I was missing the DLCs, so I went to GOG and bought the complete pack, and installed the HD mod with 1 click, 200 times better experience for 10% of the price. I sadly can't refund this purchase.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;GOG
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Buy the COMPLETE edition on GOG and download the HD mod for it (google it). More content, lower price.

297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Do yourself a favour and get the GOG version plus free HD mod instead.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I want a refund.  I bought this game to experience a classic with better graphics and smoother updated gameplay.  What I received was less content than if I loaded up my old version of the game, glitchy gameplay(to the point where I cannot scroll right on the map, but have to click on the mini map to move right), and ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE IN GAME APPEARANCE.  How can you put an HD tag on a game THAT LOOKS NO DIFFERENT!  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A BETTER LOOK AT YOUR FAVORITE OLD GAME.  THIS IS A SCAM!  THEY TOOK THE OLD GAME, TOOK AWAY CONTENT, AND CHARGED A PRETTY PENNY TO EXPLOIT PEOPLES NOSTALGIA.  Ubisoft should be ASHAMED.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"This game isn't even worth 3,74. Get the complete edition and download the unofficial HD edition to play it with way more content and in my opinion better graphics. Most of the features have bin removed like the DLC and even generated maps.Also if you're interessted in buying the complete version with the unofficial HD mod I recommend getting 2 mods called ""Horn of the Abyss"" and ""Wake of Gods"" which add even more content! If you try to make a HD version of an awesome (and nostalgic for most users) game, atleast put some more effort into it."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;THEY REMOVED THE RANDOM MAP GENERATOR!!!!!!!!!!!!WTF
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Avoid this game, while Heroes of Might and Magic III is a classic this is a easy cash grab by Ubisoft.It does not feature content from the two expansion packs Armageddons Blade and The Shadow of Death which can be bought on  as the Complete Edition. Putting on a HD mod-patch is a breaze.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Love this game very much and remember playing the original+expansions as they released.  The biggest problem of this game is that it's $15 for the very first game without either expansion included.  The ""HD"" isn't extremely noticable and certainly not another $15 worth especially since it doesn't come with the expansions.  Sadly i would not recommend this product to anyone, just look for the original ""Heroes 3 Complete"" (they use the complete picture for one of the adds kind of false advertising if you ask me) and buy that instead.  I would absolutely ammend this review in a more positive light if they add the expansions in a patch but for now it's not worth it unless you get it for less than $2."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;A timeless classic. Would recommend the complete edition on  though bc the expansions are missing in this edition and there is no mod support. thx for nothing, ubi
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;What can I say. Ubisoft really messed up this time with this game. None of the DLC's are included and the most important thing, the Random Map Generator, isnt included aswell (for whatever reason). I assume Ubisoft just wanted to milk out the very last money potential from the game, without putting much of an effort into it.If you liked the original HoMM3, then this game isnt what you are looking for, sadly.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;They blew it, this is the laziest remaster i've ever seen. Get the complete edition from GOG with an HD mod
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Horrid waste of money. No random maps, no debug commands. This game at $15 bucks vs the $6 dollar GoG version with all the expansions and random game maps and capable of installing Horns of the Abyss expansion with debug commands is night and day. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Go to Gog and play the game the way it was supposed to be played .
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Before I start reviewing this stupid ancient piece of software that is  and asking way too much from us, I'll start first by teaching people how to get best version of HOMM3, but not from Steam.Now, I shall refund this incomplete ""HD"" garbage and get back my S$4.97. This is the most half-arse attempt at a remaster I've ever seen, where the developers just put the 2D sprites on Photoshop, paint over them, and call it ""mission success"" and asking us to pay S$19.90 for this. No self respecting Heroes of Might and Magic fan should buy this game. HOMM3 HD Edition is missing ""The Armageddon's Blade"" and ""The Shadow of Death"" expansions and this game came without a random map generator, the one thing that made the game infinitely more replayable."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;It's missing expansions
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Rushed, Incomplete cash grab by the publisher.AVOID THIS PRODUCTUbisoft turned this masterpiece into a mess, by only including the base game (Restoration of Erathia) and it doesnt come with  the expansions, nor the Conflux faction that one of the expansions included. if you are a fan of this game, I reccomend you buy the Complete version and install the HD MOD on it, which creators of said mod, have also made a fan expansion Horn of The Abyss. which includes a brand new Pirate faction, a new campaign, additional map sizes, great custom maps, and a pretty great Matchmaking system with leaderboards and live chat in English, Russian, and Polish.AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Quite disapointed. Did expect more from the HD edition. You have full authority to remake a game, you could have added some extra maps, new heroes, new artifacts, new enemies, new creatures.......BUT NO! You only make it in a HD version and demand a high price for a game that is not even with the 2 expansions OR all the chronicles!Dont even buy this on sale, get it here:  and get the whole game for 8.99. Sure it's not HD, but you won't notice it. If 3DO still existed, they would be so offended by this pathetic ""HD Edition"".Sometimes, graphics is not the only thing important."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;this is a 14,99€ mockery, i should've bought a winrar licence instead
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"I have to say I absolutely love HOMM3 but this edition simply doesn't worth it, it is totally a BAD and EFFORTLESS ""remaster"".HOMM3, if you don't already know it, it's a game that has not been matched even nowadays in terms of gameplay and addiction. If you have not tried it yet, you should definitely give it an opportunity.However this ""HD"" edition, apart from some graphical rework that could be kind of ok (some Heroes portraits are terrible! -what have they done with them?!?), it has nothing to offer compared to the complete version available on GoG. It's missing lots of campaings and units (even full Conflux faction!), great features (keyboard shortcuts and UI improvements), and it has TONS of annoying bugs that could easily ruin your experience! By bugs I mean MAJOR bugs like your hero with tactics skill, doesn't get the tactics phase at the beginning of the combats, and annoying important issues like that. Add to this totally random and recurrent crashes to Desktop, that can get you totally mad if you have not saved recently in your turn.HD mod for the Complete version of this game on GoG it's far superior and better in all aspects - it adds tons of improvements for armies management, inventory..., HotA (best mod by far) adds the possibility to play a brand new faction and Heroes (pirates) in a completely new expansion, which has amazing campaigns with great storyline, superior than the original ones, and it's completely free.So, as said, forget about this edition of the game, go and get the Complete edition and the free HD mod instead, or the Horn of the Abyss expansion. Again, another example of how the dedicated community can do by far a massively better job than some greddy publishers.This atemporal jewel definitely deserved better tratement. Ubisoft just ruined it in this version."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"I will preface this by disclaiming I have been a huge fan of HoMM2 and HoMM3 since I first played the HoMM2 demo, before HoMM3 was originally released.For Singleplayer and LAN-Multiplayer, instead of this version I recommendHoMM3C = Heroes of Might and Magic: 3 Completeavailable at  drm-free and includes both official expansions (Armageddons Blade and Shadows of Death) for Heroes of Might and Magic 3. And you can find fantastic mods such as WoG ""Wake of Gods"" and HotA ""Horn of the Abyss"" to add further depth to your game.I have played HoMM3C for thousands of hours over the past 15 years.I have played (and spent countless hours attemping to play) HoMM3C over Hamachi(no longer works afaik) and GameRanger (very buggy for me, always had trouble).I purchased this version knowing it was just RoE without the expansions.The reason I wanted this was for the MULTIPLAYER on steamworks! FINALLY!!! (HD is nice too)But... There are so many problems...I do not completely agree with all the negative reviews, which seem to have come from those clueless about what they are actually buying. (Yes we know the EXPANSIONS NOT INCLUDED, they lost the source material apparently, which is a tragedy but you can't give this a bad review just for that when they tell you exactly that in the first place. Though I have to say I had hoped for a little better delivery on the multiplayer (which is the entire point of this version for me) and to a lesser extent the user interface (there is an HD-mod that is made for the old HoMM3C version which helped by adding buttons to transfer all items or units (except last 1) to another hero) and a button for purchasing ALL AVAILABLE TROOPS in a town.Cons:-Highly addicting gameplay that will absorb years of your life...-Bad reviews-Multiplayer requires port forwarding (come on, this is 2015...)-Multi-player is buggy, disconnects, cheats etc-DOES NOT INCLUDE TCP/IP LAN multiplayer (IS INCLUDED in HoMM3C version)-NO STEAM WORKSHOP-Missing all expansion content (known when announced, mods will help if developers allow)-No quick transfer/purchase buttons (I know this is only in the HD-mod, but get with the times)-Multi-display is buggy, I mouse right out of full screen mode, which minimizes instead of just scrolling across the map as I intended.Pros:-Highly addicting gameplay that will absorb years of your life!!!-Steamworks multiplayer-Hotseat multiplayer-Thousands of gameplay hours-HD graphics (supposedly 30000+ hours of retexturing)-Community modders converting expansion mapsHopes/dreams for the future:-NO PORT FORWARDING in multiplayer-Workshop support-Expansion content(community reverse-engingeered if it must be!)That said, I am still very much enjoying this game again. The lack of buttons to 1 click-transfer units/items or purchase all available troops are SORELY MISSED. So I will probably go back to the HoMM3C version with HD mod when not attempting to play multiplayer.I really want to give this a positive review, and will do so if they manage to fix the issues that plague multiplayer and user-interface.The ball is in your court development team!"
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Its actually quite a shame that one of the ""greatest original games of all times"", has a ""mixed"" overall review rating, all because Ubisoft shot itself in the foot by failing to release the expansions in HD at the same time as the base game.Its quite possible that Heroes Of Might & Magic 2,3,4 are among the most influential games I have ever played. It is the first game I recall playing all night, the first series I bought a better computer to play and the only series I have replayed hundreds of times over 20 years.It is hard to overstate HOMM's impact on the gaming industry as a whole, some of the gameplay mechanics in this series were groundbreaking at the time and have since became staples in other gamesIn reality, ""this"" (this being an HD remake of the original game, which is for sale on an easily accesable platform) might be the only way a certain demographic of younger gamers could otherwise access this old and by default obscure game which stands the test of time and which has still yet to be legitimately replicated or improved upon."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"Just buy the normal Heroes of Might and Magic III Gold on GoG - you will have both the Armageddon's Blade and Shadow of Death and you can install HD mod to make it look better than this ""HD Edition"". Also you can have more quality mods on the GoG version. This one right here is just the worst version of Heroes III."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Would have recommended this game, if it was the Complete version. Ubisoft have lost a lot of potential income, and all they need to do is add the complete version. This is the reason people buy the game from GOG instead. It's so obvious that it's stupid. There's also many bugs that appears doing the game. For example, the town music just restarts every time you visit. I feel so bad about this game and Ubisoft does not seem to care at all........
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;"This is not the full version with all expansions. It just contains the first of three big story line campaign ""Restoration of Erathia"". As a result 66% of the game is still missing: ""Armageddons Blade"", ""Shadow of Death"" and even the ""Chronicles""."
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Ignore the time spent: I've logged so many hours in this game I still hear all the sound and music even if everything is turned off.  This game was my crack when it first came out and it's been my crack ever since.  I haven't owned a computer without it.  While not my all-time favorite entry in the series, it's the most absolutely joyfully solid old classic game.  THAT SAID you can also buy this game on  and they have all the expansions/complete edition so like.  Do yourself a solid and get the whole-joy experience.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I've just bought Heroes 3 on  for 3$. Just compare 15$ here for restoration of rathia with many bugs and 3$ on  for full HOM&M 3 experience.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Add expansions PLZZZ :D !!!
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;We want the dlcs! We want the full game
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Please release the HD version of Shadow of Death
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Shameless cashgrab. Content is heavily nerfed and it doesn't work with WoG or other mods. Get the GoG version if you want to play this gem.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Doesn't have the expansions and no map generator. Would be great and good little upgrade if these were included. You can get the Heroes of Might & Magic 3 Complete on GOG for cheap and it is totally playable sitll.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;The game itself is great, but the Steam release does not contain any of the expansion packs and is missing a bunch of really great features (including the random map generator!). Get it, but not from here. Try a certain online store with DRM-free products. *wink*
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;I bought this for the nostalgia factor. I wanted to see an updated version of a childhood classic. Instead the game is missing key parts, such as the random map generator. Is it playable? Sure. But sometimes I want a random map to play around with, not one of the premade scenarios.The graphical update is minimal, and honestly, laughable. Just a few changed monster designs and a quick polish to icons. you have to be looking for the differences to find them, it doesn't stand out. Its not worth the bullet point given to it in the product description.Will I play more of this? Yes, just so I can feel like I've gotten my money's worth out of it. But your money is better spent at GoG where you'll get the orignal game plus both expansions (which is what we're all looking for anyway). But I will say, it is fun having access to the map editor again.
297000;Heroes of Might & Magic III;Hi everyone,just wanna let you know that this version of Heroes is just cash ripper. Search for HoTa on the internet, it's running on servers as this version. It is more balanced, and till now it is updated, even addded new fraction. I bought this, was wondering where is random generator of the Map or why is Necro so op. Bcs this version is rly old and they just made HD of it and 'gimme money'.... Thank you Ubisoft, you just made me think you are a joke of a company. Remember don't buy this, buy only Complete Version on the internet, for example GoG and then download unofficial official HotA pack to it. Search for details on websites or youtube, there are tons of guides.Have a nice day fellas
